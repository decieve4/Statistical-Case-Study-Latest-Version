# Assignment1



1. Investigate whether **stylometric methods** <u>from this course</u> are able to accurately identify the authorship of the texts that have a known author (i.e. texts other than Frankenstein). This will demonstrate that these methods are accurate and reliable for studying 19th century English fiction.
2. Perform analysis to determine which of the supplied authors was most likely to have written Frankenstein (which is contained in the ‘Unknown’ folder).
3. Create a report summarizing your findings. This should be have a maximum page length of 5 pages, not including any pictures.



## Content



1. A brief introduction containing an executive summary of your findings. Try to write this so that it would be understandable to someone who did not know the details of stylometry.
2. A description/investigation of the datasets used in your report. You should assume the reader is unfamilar with this.
3. A short discussion of the methods which you will use for the analysis.
4. Some accuracy metrics that show how well your methods perform when attributing the texts with known authorship (for example, using leaveone-out cross validation which we will discuss next week).
5. Your analysis of Frankenstein, and your conclusions.
