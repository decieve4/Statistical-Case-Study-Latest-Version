The narrative surrounding the economic landscape in many Western countries often paints immigrants as scapegoats for the challenges faced by local workers. While it is indisputable that the influx of immigrants can influence job markets and wage levels, attributing the plight of workers predominantly to immigrant labor overlooks a more complex reality. The policies enacted by governments, rather than the presence of immigrants, play a crucial role in shaping labor markets and worker conditions. The erosion of worker rights, the decline of labor unions, and neoliberal economic policies can be traced back to governmental actions that prioritize corporate interests over those of the working class.

In recent decades, many Western governments have adopted neoliberal approaches to economic management, which prioritize deregulation, privatization, and free market principles. This shift, often hailed as a route to economic efficiency and growth, has had significant repercussions for the working class. They have witnessed a gradual dismantling of the social safety nets and worker protections that were hard-won during the 20th century. Policies that once guaranteed fair wages, job security, and safe working conditions have eroded, creating a precarious environment for many workers, regardless of their origins. 

Moreover, the decline of labor unions has played a pivotal role in the repression of workers in the West. Unions have historically been instrumental in advocating for worker rights, negotiating better pay, and ensuring safe working conditions. However, years of legislative changes and aggressive anti-union sentiment fostered by governments and corporations have weakened union power. This decline is not primarily due to the presence of immigrants in the labor force but rather a concerted effort by political leaders to undermine collective bargaining in favor of flexible labor markets. In many cases, these policies are backed by claims that labor markets must be kept competitive, yet they often result in lower wages and diminished job security for local workers.

Additionally, austerity measures implemented following economic crises further illustrate how government policies have constituted a profound source of repression for workers. In the wake of the 2008 financial meltdown, many Western governments responded with austere budgets that slashed vital public services and welfare programs. The burden of economic recovery was placed disproportionately on the working class, who faced job losses, wage stagnation, and increased social inequality. Programs intended to support workers during transitional periods were often the first areas to be cut, leaving many to fend for themselves amidst economic turbulence. In this scenario, immigrants are not the perpetrators but rather sometimes fellow victims navigating the same hostile economic environment brought about by government decisions.

The demonization of immigrants also serves a political purpose, diverting attention away from the structural issues affecting workers in the West. Politicians have often used anti-immigrant rhetoric to galvanize support by framing economic challenges as a consequence of a foreign influx, rather than admitting the failures of government policy. This tactic can rally public sentiment by providing identifiable scapegoats for complex economic issues. As a result, the focus remains on the figure of the immigrant rather than on disparity in power dynamics, shifting the conversation from the need for systemic reforms to the desirability of restricting immigration.

Moreover, the governmentâ€™s complicity in perpetuating a race to the bottom among workers is illustrated through labor market policies that favor exploitation. As competition intensifies, employers increasingly seek to reduce costs, frequently employing strategies that undermine wages and conditions for all workers, both foreign and domestic. Rather than creating an equitable labor market, this race to the bottom diminishes the quality of jobs overall. In this context, immigrants become part of the narrative that obscures the real issue: the failure of government systems to ensure a living wage and decent working conditions for all.

Furthermore, many policies that ostensibly aim to help workers often end up perpetuating divisions among them. Welfare reforms, for instance, may reinforce stigma against certain groups while proving detrimental to those in need, including both local and immigrant populations. In attempting to create a more competitive labor market, governments neglect the essential human aspect of work and economic contributions, undermining social cohesion. These policies breed mistrust and animosity among different groups, pitting workers against each other instead of focusing on shared interests in improving labor standards.

The conversation surrounding workers' rights in the West must expand beyond simplistic narratives and focus on the systemic issues stemming from governmental policies. Acknowledging that workers are repressed, not just by an influx of immigrants but by the very structures established and maintained by their own governments, is fundamental to understanding the modern economic landscape. This acknowledgment calls for a reinvigoration of labor movements and collective action that focuses not only on the injustices experienced by local workers but also on the shared experiences and struggles of all workers.

To move forward, there needs to be a concerted effort to recognize the value of all labor, regardless of nationality, and rebuild the protections that have been eroded over time. Policies can be revitalized to protect workers' rights, elevate wages, and create a fair labor environment in which the contributions of all are recognized. In doing so, it becomes possible to chart a path toward a more equitable society, free from the divisive narratives that serve to obscure the underlying issues at play. Only through this lens can the true source of worker repression in the West be addressed, emphasizing solidarity rather than division, and resilience instead of fear. Ultimately, the focus should not lie in fearing the other but in confronting the systems that perpetuate inequality and hinder progress for all workers.
