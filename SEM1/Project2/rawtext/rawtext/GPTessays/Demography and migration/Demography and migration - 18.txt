When I left Nigeria for Belgium, I embarked on a journey that would redefine my concept of home. As I stepped onto the plane, leaving the familiar vibrancy of Lagos behind, I was filled with a mixture of excitement and trepidation. The prospect of starting anew in a different land was enticing, yet the thought of leaving loved ones and cherished memories weighed heavily in my heart. My husband, who had settled in Belgium a few years before, awaited my arrival with open arms and hopeful dreams for our life together. As I navigated through the hustle and bustle of the airport, surrounded by a cacophony of languages, I often reflected on the world I was leaving behind—filled with colorful markets, the comforting sounds of familiar dialects, and the warmth of family gatherings. 

Settling into my husband’s home was an intricate tapestry of adapting and integrating. Each day revealed unique challenges, from understanding the intricacies of the Belgian healthcare system to deciphering the differences in social etiquette. My husband embraced me with kindness, encouraging me to explore my new surroundings. I wandered through cobblestoned streets lined with quaint cafés and historic buildings, immersing myself in the sights, sounds, and flavors of this new environment. I found solace in the delicate pastries and rich chocolates that Belgium is renowned for, yet amid my exploration, fragments of my identity began to unravel. 

Belgium often feels like a mosaic of cultures—a blend of Flemish and Walloon traditions, interspersed with influences from neighboring countries. However, in my case, it was the weight of cultural dislocation that loomed large. The duality of my existence became starkly apparent. While I embraced the beauty of my new surroundings—gazing at the stunning architecture of Brussels and the serene canals of Bruges—there remained an undercurrent of longing for the rhythms of my previous life. I missed the gestures of familiarity, the way friends would gather unannounced, the vibrant sounds of Yoruba lacing the air, stories interwoven with laughter and the rich smell of jollof rice wafting through the kitchen. 

Integration into this new world demanded both resilience and adaptation. Language became my greatest barrier. My husband spoke French fluently, and while I had a basic understanding of the language, I felt a palpable fear every time I ventured out to engage with my neighbors or order from the local market. What if they judged my accent? What if I mispronounced a word and inadvertently offended someone? These worries loomed like shadows, often leading me to withdraw rather than engage. My husband's unwavering support helped bridge this gap; he encouraged me to take language classes and seize every opportunity to practice speaking. Slowly, I began to piece together a new lexicon, a new mode of expression.

With time, I decorated our home, layering it with elements of my Nigerian heritage. Bright, warm colors adorned the walls, and artifacts from local markets accompanied the modern Belgian furnishings. I hung photographs capturing moments from family gatherings and brought small treasures from Nigeria—a calabash, a woven basket, and traditional art pieces that spoke in vibrant hues. Each item whispered a story, a connection to my roots. However, despite my efforts to create a sense of belonging, a sense of alienation often crept in, gnawing at the edges of my newfound identity. I was caught in an unshakeable feeling of displacement that couldn’t be ignored.

As seasons passed, I found rhythms in our neighborhood. I learned to navigate the intricacies of social gatherings, often sharing a laugh or two with neighbors over coffee. Yet when evening fell, and the city settled into a hushed lullaby, I often found myself ensnared in profound loneliness. The longing for home transformed into a palpable ache, a heaviness that lodged like a stone inside my heart. I would sit in my husband’s cozy living room, tangled in blankets, viewing old photos on my phone—my family’s milestones, celebrations, and everyday joys captured in pixels. I found comfort in these memories, yet each image magnified my heartache, reminding me of the distance between us.

In my quest for belonging, I sought out communities. I connected with fellow expatriates, developing friendships with women from various corners of the globe. We shared the tales of our homelands, exchanged traditional recipes, and navigated the myriad challenges of living abroad. These connections provided a brief respite from my homesickness, yet the feeling of not quite belonging lingered. I realized that while I shared experiences with others, our backgrounds often diverged so fundamentally that the pangs of homesickness felt isolating.

The growing distance from my homeland sharpened my identity. Through this ache, I began to understand the nuances of my emotions. It became apparent that homesickness was not merely a longing for a place; it was also a yearning for the experiences and people that shaped my identity. It was tied to the laughter of my childhood, the lessons taught by my grandmother, and the heartbeat of the Yoruba traditions that ran deep within me. This comprehension invited a new perspective, allowing me to embrace my emotions rather than view them as barriers. 

In the face of homesickness, I found ways to weave my heritage into the fabric of my life in Belgium. I began hosting small gatherings, cooking traditional Nigerian meals, and inviting friends to share in these experiences. Their willingness to taste my culture filled my heart with joy, and I smiled as I watched them savor jollof rice and plantains with curiosity. Slowly, I began stitching together the threads of my identity, merging them with my new surroundings, creating a unique tapestry that honored both worlds.

Days turned into months, and with each passing season, the stone inside my heart began to take on a different form. While it never fully dissolved, I learned to carry it with grace—an acknowledgment of my past, a companion rather than an intruder. It became a reminder of the love that anchored me to Nigeria while also propelling me forward into my life in Belgium. The song of my childhood morphed into a new melody, blending the rhythms of two distinct worlds into a harmonious composition, singing a tale of resilience, love, and the ties that bind us to our senses of home. 

As I continue to navigate this ongoing journey of duality, I cherish both sides of my identity—the vibrant heart of Nigeria and the intricate beauty of Belgium. Each day is a step forward, a microcosm of experiences that allow me to honor my past while embracing the richness of my present. It's a delicate dance, one that I engage in with an open heart, acknowledging that while a fragment of me will always long for home, I have the capacity to make my husband’s home my own, too.
