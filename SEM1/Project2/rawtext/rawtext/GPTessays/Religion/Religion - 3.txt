The Sunni movement of Salafism emerged as a significant religious and reformist ideology in the early 20th century, seeking to return to what its adherents consider the purest form of Islam by emulating the practices, beliefs, and societal norms of the 7th century. This movement is characterized by a strict interpretation of the Quran and Sunnah, the teachings and practices of the Prophet Muhammad, prioritizing authenticity in faith and practice. The Salafist movement is rooted in the term "Salaf," which refers to the early generations of Muslims, particularly the companions of the Prophet and the two subsequent generations that closely followed them. The proponents of this movement believe that returning to the methodologies and lifestyles of these early Muslims is essential to revive the faith and restore the ummah, or Muslim community, to what they perceive as its former glory.

The historical context for the emergence of Salafism is essential to understanding its development. The late 19th and early 20th centuries witnessed significant political, social, and economic upheaval across the Muslim world. The decline of the Ottoman Empire, European colonialism, and the accompanying cultural imperialism challenged traditional Islamic structures, leading to a profound crisis of identity among Muslims. In this context, many intellectuals and religious thinkers sought to reclaim and redefine Islam in response to these external pressures. Salafism emerged as one of the responses to modernity, advocating for a return to foundational Islamic values while addressing contemporary issues.

One of the prominent figures in the early development of Salafism was Jamal al-Din al-Afghani, an influential political activist and thinker. Al-Afghani emphasized the need for a rational interpretation of Islam, advocating for a reevaluation of Islamic thought within the modern world. He believed that Muslims should engage with modernity while remaining rooted in their religious identity. His advocacy for a pan-Islamic unity and social reform contributed to a broader discourse on Islamic identity, paving the way for various reform movements, including Salafism.

Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, a key figure in Islamic jurisprudence and one of the founders of the Hanbali school, is often heralded as a foundational influence for Salafism. His emphasis on adhering strictly to the sources of Islamic teachings—namely, the Quran and authentic Hadith—served as a model for later Salafi thinkers who sought to reject innovations (bid'ah) in religious practice that they argued had corrupted the faith. The Salafi movement, therefore, is marked by its insistence on a literalist approach to Islamic texts and a rejection of any practices that diverge from original teachings.

The early 20th century also saw the rise of notable Salafi scholars, such as Muhammad Abduh and Rashid Rida. Abduh, an Egyptian theologian and reformer, sought to reconcile Islam with modernity by advocating a rational approach to belief and practice. He believed that Islam had the capacity to adapt to contemporary challenges without losing its essential character. However, Rida took a more conservative approach, seeking a return to what he believed were the core principles of Islam as practiced by the Salaf. Rida's works laid the groundwork for more radical iterations of Salafism that emerged later in the 20th century, particularly with the establishment of the Ikhwan al-Muslimin (Muslim Brotherhood) and other Islamist movements.

The rise of Salafism can also be connected to geopolitical events in the Muslim world. The partitioning of former Ottoman territories and the establishment of nation-states created a new political landscape that many Muslims perceived as a betrayal of Islamic unity. The establishment of Israel in 1948 and the subsequent Arab-Israeli conflict further exacerbated feelings of disillusionment and despair among Muslims. Salafism appealed to those disenchanted with the status quo, offering a framework for addressing grievances and aspiring for political and social change grounded in a strictly defined Islamic doctrine.

By the late 20th century, Salafism began to diversify into various streams, from peaceful advocacy for reform to more militant factions. The rise of jihadist groups in the 1980s and 1990s highlighted the extremities within the Salafi spectrum. While many Salafis emphasize education, spirituality, and social justice, others adopt a more aggressive stance, fueled by perceived injustices faced by Muslims around the world. The interplay between Salafism and political Islam has led to a complex and multifaceted relationship with contemporary governance, causing varying degrees of engagement from outright opposition to calls for reform.

Moreover, the advent of globalization and technology has allowed Salafism to spread beyond national borders, gaining traction among disaffected Muslim youth in various parts of the world. The proliferation of Islamic satellite channels, online sermons, and social media platforms has facilitated the dissemination of Salafi ideologies, enabling networks of like-minded individuals to connect and mobilize around shared beliefs. This access to information has made Salafism particularly appealing to those seeking a sense of belonging in an increasingly fragmented world.

In conclusion, the Sunni movement of Salafism, born in the early 20th century, reflects the tensions and transformations faced by Muslims in response to modernity, colonialism, and geopolitical shifts. It represents both a return to foundational Islamic values and a response to contemporary realities. While Salafism emphasizes a strict adherence to the Quran and the Sunnah, it encompasses a range of beliefs and practices that reflect the diversity within the Muslim community. As the movement continues to evolve, it presents both challenges and opportunities for the broader discourse on Islam and its place in the modern world. Ultimately, the Salafi aim of modeling life on the 7th century is an enduring endeavor, rooted in a profound desire to restore what its adherents view as the authentic essence of Islam amidst the complexities of contemporary life.
