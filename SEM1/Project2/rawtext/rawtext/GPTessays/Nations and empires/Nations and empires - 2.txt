Imperial Russia's geographic positioning presented it with unique challenges and opportunities in its pursuit of expansion and influence. Unlike many Western empires that basked in the abundances of tropical climates and their abundant resources, Russia's vast expanse often overshadowed regions rich in tropical bounty. This lack of direct access to these lucrative areas influenced Russia's imperial strategy and pushed it to seek alternative means to procure the resources and agricultural products that characterized the wealth of tropics. The Caucasus region emerged as a pivotal area for this purpose, transforming into what could be termed a synthetic "tropical" zone for Imperial Russia. 

The Caucasus, located at the crossroads of Europe and Asia, rich in natural diversity, became an attractive target for Russian imperial ambitions. The Russian Empire began to exert control over this mountainous territory in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, through a series of military campaigns and strategic alliances. The region offered fertile land suitable for the cultivation of crops that were traditionally associated with warmer climates, such as grapes and various fruits, alongside its rich reserves of natural resources like oil, minerals, and timber.

The presence of different ethnic communities in the Caucasus was both a boon and a challenge for the imperial authorities. The region was home to various peoples, including Armenians, Georgians, Chechens, and others, each with rich cultural traditions and agricultural practices. The Russian Empire sought to integrate these groups into its economic system while also managing the complexities of ethnic diversity. The introduction of Russian administrative systems helped reshape local agricultural practices, pushing for the cultivation of crops that could emulate the food systems characteristic of tropical environments. This transformation not only sought to enhance agricultural output but also to integrate the region more deeply into the imperial economy.

One significant endeavor in this transformation was the promotion of viticulture in the Caucasus, particularly in regions such as Georgia. The Russian Empire recognized the potential of wine production as a lucrative industry that could rival the wines of France and Italy, which were celebrated throughout Europe. The successful establishment of vineyards and the extraction of wine became emblematic of the Caucasus as a "tropical hinterland." The unique climate of the region, with its diverse microclimates, allowed for the cultivation of high-quality grapes, leading to exports that contributed significantly to the coffers of the empire.

Parallel to the cultivation of temperate crops was the discovery and exploitation of natural resources in the Caucasus, particularly oil in regions like Baku. The late 19th century saw Baku emerge as a critical hub for the oil industry, eventually becoming one of the world’s leading oil production centers. This newfound wealth fueled further imperial ambitions, with the Russian state investing heavily in infrastructure to facilitate the flow of resources from the Caucasus to the industrial centers in Russia and beyond. The growth of industries related to oil extraction and processing showcased the imperial capability to create its own economic "tropics"—environments that could yield profits rivaling those found in true tropical regions.

However, the transformation of the Caucasus was not without its challenges. The push for agrarian change often provoked tensions with local populations, disrupting traditional agricultural practices and leading to resistance among different ethnic groups. The Russian Empire's policies were frequently marked by a heavy-handed approach, with military interventions at various points aimed at subjugating dissent and maintaining control over this strategically important region. Such measures underscored the complexities of imperial management in a diverse territory that sought to reflect the empire’s ambitions while fostering internal dissent.

The interplay between imperial expansion and local traditions in the Caucasus led to a unique cultural synthesis that further complicated the Russian identity. The incorporation of various aspects of local customs into Russian practices enrichened the cultural landscape of the empire. This exchange also implicated a growing consciousness in Russia regarding national identity, as the empire grappled with its role as both administrator and settler—a dualism that was marked by its attempts to assert control while also integrating local culture.

The cultivation of a "tropical" ethos within the Caucasus left lasting legacies that shaped not only the imperial project but also the post-imperial period that followed. The infrastructure and agricultural innovations developed during the imperial era continued to influence the region long after the fall of the Russian Empire. The Soviet era further solidified the role of the Caucasus as a vital agricultural and resource-rich area, but also often underlined the friction inherent in the blend of local demands and centralized policies.

The legacy of Russia's investment in the Caucasus reflects broader themes within imperial history, where the adaptation of colonial strategies to local contexts reveals the complexities of empire-building. The creation of a bountiful "tropical" setting within the Caucasus illustrates how Imperials often looked beyond their own geographical constraints, utilizing the resources and potential of diverse regions to fulfill their aspirations. The policies enacted during Imperial Russia laid the groundwork for future developments—both beneficial and detrimental—allowing the Caucasus to maintain its significance as a focal point for cultural and economic exchanges long after the empire receded.

In conclusion, Imperial Russia's lack of natural access to tropical resources drove it to create its own economic and agricultural landscape in the Caucasus. The region emerged as a pivotal space where imperial ambitions and local identities intertwined, creating a synthetic tropical zone that addressed some of the empire's needs while simultaneously confronting the realities of ethnic diversity and resistance. This complex relationship continues to have ramifications even today, as the historical legacies of imperial interventions remain evident in the social, cultural, and economic fabric of the region.
