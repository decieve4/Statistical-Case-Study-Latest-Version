In recent years, the political landscape has seen a significant shift from globalism to nationalism, capturing the attention and concern of scholars, policymakers, and citizens alike. This shift has manifested in various forms across the world, including the rise of populist movements, the resurgence of nation-centric ideologies, and a palpable skepticism toward international institutions and agreements. While some progressives may perceive this trend as a temporary backlash against globalization, their optimism about the possibility of reconciling their principles with rising nationalist sentiments is dangerously naive. The implications of this new world order are profound, requiring a deeper examination of the dynamics at play and an understanding that nationalism is a powerful and, at times, volatile force that operates independently of progressive ideals.

Nationalism, at its core, emphasizes the primacy of the nation-state and the interests, culture, and identity of its people. It challenges the globalist perspective that promotes transnational cooperation, multiculturalism, and the idea that problems and solutions transcend borders. The rise of nationalism has been punctuated by events such as Brexit, the election of Donald Trump, and the growing influence of far-right parties in Europe and beyond. These movements are fueled by a sense of disenfranchisement among populations who feel left behind by rapid globalization, including the erosion of traditional job sectors, cultural shifts, and perceived threats to national identity. In this context, nationalism appeals to those who seek a return to sovereignty, prioritizing domestic issues over international commitments.

Progressives who yearn to ride the wave of nationalism, believing they can infuse it with their values of social justice, equity, and environmental responsibility, overlook the fundamental contradictions between these two ideologies. Nationalistic movements often thrive on exclusionary rhetoric, scapegoating marginalized communities, and rejecting the notion of collective global responsibility. While progressives advocate for inclusivity and diversity, many nationalist movements are defined by their opposition to multiculturalism and immigration, seeing them as threats to national cohesion. This divergence creates an unbridgeable chasm that is not easily crossed. Attempting to align progressivism with nationalism can dilute and compromise the very principles that define progressive ideologies, leading to a betrayal of core values.

Moreover, nationalism tends to be reactive, often arising in response to crises or perceived external threats. The COVID-19 pandemic, for example, underscored the vulnerability of global interconnectedness, prompting many nations to prioritize their own citizens over global solidarity. In times of crisis, the instinct to retreat into national identity can supplant more progressive priorities such as climate action or humanitarian aid. Progressives advocating for global cooperation might find themselves sidelined, as nationalist narratives prioritize sovereignty over solidarity. This underscores the precarious nature of trying to integrate progressive demands within a framework that is fundamentally opposed to their expansive vision of social justice and interconnectedness.

Furthermore, the implications of aligning with nationalism can have severe consequences for international collaboration on pressing issues such as climate change, human rights, and global health. Nationalist policies often lead to the dismantling of international agreements and the weakening of cooperation among nations. A progressive agenda that relies on multinational partnerships and collaborative frameworks could be severely undermined in a world dominated by nationalistic fervor. The dangers of this dynamic were starkly illustrated in the aftermath of the Paris Agreement on climate change, where certain nationalist governments reneged on commitments to mitigate their environmental impact, prioritizing short-term economic gains over global stewardship.

Additionally, embracing nationalism can lead progressives into alliances with dubious stakeholders who may co-opt their messages without genuine commitment to their ideals. History has shown that movements can morph into vehicles for more reactionary politics, where populist leaders harness the discontent of the masses to consolidate power while undermining democratic processes. Progressives, in their desire to be part of the conversation, may overlook the underlying authoritarian tendencies or anti-democratic sentiments that can accompany nationalist movements. This could not only jeopardize progressive objectives but also further entrench regressive policies that harm the very communities progressives aim to uplift.

The notion that progressives can mold nationalism into a force for good is predicated on a misunderstanding of the historical and ideological roots of nationalism itself. Nationalism has often been intertwined with exclusion, revivalist sentiments, and xenophobia, driving wedges between communities rather than fostering understanding and equity. It is shortsighted for progressives to assume that their values can seamlessly integrate with a movement that has been historically associated with the repression of dissent, and the curtailment of human rights under the guise of protecting the nation.

In navigating this complex landscape, progressives must critically assess their strategies and consider the long-term consequences of pursuing alliances with nationalist movements. Instead, they should focus on an alternative vision that transcends national boundaries while addressing the genuine concerns that fuel nationalist sentiments. By advocating for inclusive policies that promote social justice, economic equity, and environmental sustainability, progressives can respond effectively to the needs of disillusioned populations without sacrificing their foundational beliefs or compromising their principles.

Ultimately, the rise of nationalism is not a passing trend but a significant reconfiguration of global politics that calls for a thoughtful and strategic response from progressives. An attempt to co-opt nationalist sentiment is fraught with danger, risking the dilution of core progressive ideals and further entrenching forces that oppose inclusivity and justice. Instead of seeking alignment with nationalism, progressives should work to build a more robust and resilient framework that embraces global interconnectedness while addressing the systemic inequities that have given rise to nationalism in the first place. In doing so, they can create a future that redefines what it means to be both a citizen of a nation and a global community, charting a path that recognizes our shared responsibilities while respecting the diverse identities that enrich our world.
