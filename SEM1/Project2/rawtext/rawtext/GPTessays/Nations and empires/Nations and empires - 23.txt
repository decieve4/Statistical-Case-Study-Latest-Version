In the 20th century, Turkey underwent significant social, political, and cultural transformations, emerging from the ashes of the Ottoman Empire and seeking to redefine Turkish identity in a rapidly modernizing world. The intertwined themes of modernity, nationalism, and racial identity played critical roles in forming the narrative of what it meant to be Turkish. Among the many discourses that shaped this identity, eugenics and the invocation of an ancient Asian past emerged prominently, as Turkish intellectuals and politicians endeavored to position the Turks as a "white," racially superior people within the broader hierarchy of civilizations.

The backdrop for this phenomenon was the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in the wake of World War I. This dissolution prompted a nationalist awakening, spearheaded by figures like Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, who sought to create a modern, secular state that was distinct from its imperial legacy. Atatürk's vision for the Republic of Turkey was one marked by Westernization and modernization. However, this transformation was not merely political or economic; it also encompassed a reimagining of Turkish identity that necessitated the alignment of national unity with racial purity. The concept of race gained traction during the early decades of the 20th century, influenced by the burgeoning sciences of eugenics and the prevailing theories of evolution that permeated Western discourse.

Eugenics, as a scientific movement, aimed at improving the human population by means of controlled breeding. It gained prominence in the early 20th century, particularly in the United States and Europe, where it was often entangled with notions of racial superiority and inferiority. In Turkey, eugenics was embraced by a segment of the intelligentsia who viewed it as a way to bolster national strength. Turkish modernizers appropriated these ideas, perceiving the racially restrictive theories espoused by eugenicists as a means to counter the perceived degeneracy of the Ottoman past. They argued for a vision of the Turkish nation that was racially homogenous and descended from a lineage that was both ancient and superior.

Furthermore, the modernizers sought to establish a narrative that connected the Turks to a glorious, ancient lineage. This narrative was a critical response to the significant demographic changes resulting from the mass migrations, wars, and population exchanges that followed the formation of the Republic. Among the various historical theories posited by scholars and politicians was the notion that the Turks were not merely the inheritors of a diverse Ottoman identity but were descendants of a great, white race that had its origins in Central Asia. This mythologizing of the Turkish past involved an intricate and selective engagement with history, wherein ancient records, language studies, and archaeological findings were manipulated to construct a narrative of superiority.

The search for an "ancient Asian past" was further fueled by the political context of the time, as Turkey navigated its identity amid competing nationalisms. The leaders of the Republic sought to establish a bond with the Turkic peoples of Central Asia, emphasizing the shared traits of race and culture. This was not merely an academic endeavor; it was a crucial part of state propaganda that aimed to consolidate national unity amid the fragmentation left over from the Ottoman Empire. The proposed linkage to an idealized Central Asian heritage allowed Turkish nationalists to reject the ethnic and cultural diversity of their immediate past and embrace a mythical connection to a dominant and racially superior ancestry.

One of the most powerful symbols of this narrative was the creation of the "Sun Language Theory," which posited that the Turkish language was the root of all languages and that its speakers were thus linguistically and racially superior. This theory, propagated by figures such as Hüseyin Nihal Atsız, sought to reinforce the idea that the Turks were an ancient people of great significance in world history, capable of reasserting their status as a white, civilized race in a world increasingly dominated by notions of racial hierarchy and superiority.

The focus on eugenics also manifested in public health and social policies aimed at promoting a "healthy" Turkish population. Initiatives targeting maternal and child health were framed in eugenic terms, emphasizing the need for the propagation of a "pure" Turkish race. This led to state-supported campaigns that promoted high birth rates among "desirable" families, discouraging those deemed "unfit." Such measures were not isolated but functioned within a broader context of national development that blended modern science with nationalistic fervor.

These endeavors did not go unchallenged, as questions of identity, ethnicity, and the implications of eugenics aroused significant debate within Turkey. Critics emerged from various intellectual circles, questioning the validity and ethical implications of eugenic policies. They warned against oversimplified notions of race and identity, emphasizing the complex history of the Turks and their multifaceted identity that could not be reduced to racial categories. However, these dissenting voices often struggled to gain traction in the face of the dominant narratives that consumed public discourse.

In conclusion, the modernizers of 20th-century Turkey adeptly intertwined the ideologies of eugenics and claims of an ancient Asian past to construct a vision of Turkish identity that aligned with the broader aspirations of a modern, secular nation-state. This narrative sought to redefine the Turkish populace in racial terms, promoting notions of racial purity and superiority while drawing selectively from history to affirm their claims. The implications of these ideas were profound, impacting the socio-political landscape of Turkey and shaping national identity for decades to come. Ultimately, this complex interplay reflected broader trends in global modernization, nationalism, and the often troubling histories associated with race, evolution, and eugenics.
