The Soviet Union, founded in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution of 1917, was envisioned by Lenin as a unified entity where various nationalities could collaborate under the banner of socialism. Lenin's vision was one of internationalism and unity among the oppressed peoples of the world, aspiring toward a society that transcended national borders. He believed in the right of nations to self-determination, which meant that individual ethnic groups could pursue their own independent paths as long as they ultimately contributed to the greater socialist cause. Lenin's pragmatic approach to nationalism sought to alleviate the grievances of non-Russian peoples within the vast expanse of the Russian Empire by acknowledging their cultural identities and aspirations. However, while his ideological framework aimed at unification through class struggle and revolutionary zeal, it inadvertently set the stage for future tensions as it confronted the deep-seated ties of culture and identity that had persisted through centuries of Russian dominance.

In stark contrast to Lenin's internationalism, Joseph Stalin's tenure brought forth notions of Russian nationalism that began shaping the Soviet identity. Stalin famously referred to Russia as "the first among equals" within the Soviet Union, a perspective that reflected and reinforced the centrality of Russian culture, language, and political structure in the union of republics. This shift not only reaffirmed the dominance of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) but also created a hierarchical structure within the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) that often marginalized non-Russian nationalities. This was exemplified by the implementation of policies that promoted the Russian language and culture at the expense of regional languages and practices. The educational system, the media, and even local governance were often dominated by Russian influences, making the Russian narrative the standard against which all other cultures were measured.

The interplay between Lenin's vision and Stalin's nationalism reveals a significant evolving dynamic in Soviet society. While Lenin sought to create a multi-ethnic federation, Stalin effectively fostered a national identity that was distinctly Russian, inviting a set of contradictions that would become evident as the Soviet Union matured. The tensions between these two approaches resulted in resentment among non-Russian republics and ethnic groups. The celebration of Russian heroes, the emphasis on Russian literature, and the portrayal of Russian history overshadowed the legacies of other ethnic groups within the Soviet Union. This narrative invariably led to a rise in nationalist sentiments among various republics, as local populations began to recognize their cultural identities in opposition to the dominant narrative imposed from Moscow.

The prominence of various nationalist movements within the USSR highlighted a paradoxical reality: while the Soviet leadership, particularly during Stalin's regime, sought to suppress regional identities and foster a pan-Soviet identity, it also unwittingly fueled nationalist sentiments. Instances such as the Ukrainian Holodomor during the 1930s illustrated the catastrophic consequences of this disregard for local identities. The catastrophic famine not only decimated populations but also engendered deep-seated animosity toward the Russian central government. In contrast to the aspirations of unity touted by Soviet leaders, events such as these bolstered the threads of nationalism that lived through the hardships and histories of various ethnic groups.

The complex interplay between Soviet ideology and local identities persisted even after Stalin's reign. Following World War II, the USSR witnessed a fresh wave of nationalism, often propelled by a desire to reclaim cultural heritage and seek political autonomy. The policies of Nikita Khrushchev during the 1950s, which sought to de-Stalinize the political landscape, also allowed for a degree of cultural expression that had previously been stifled. However, the central leadership's attempts to balance the Russian narrative with the recognition of non-Russian identities were often fraught with tension. While local cultures were permitted to flourish to some extent, they remained overshadowed by the overarching Soviet narrative that emphasized a collective Soviet identity. Nevertheless, this era witnessed an awakening of national consciousness, particularly in the Baltic states, Ukraine, and the Caucasus, where citizens began to articulate their cultural identities in ways that significantly challenged Soviet orthodoxy.

As the 1980s unfolded, the Soviet leadership, under Mikhail Gorbachev, encountered mounting pressures from nationalist movements across the republics. Gorbachev's policies of glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring) inadvertently provided platforms for expressing nationalist sentiments that had long been suppressed. Ethnic groups, emboldened by the opportunity to demand greater autonomy, illuminated the stark contradictions in the Soviet principle of unity. The push for independence gained momentum, culminating in the historic events of the late 1980s and early 1990s, wherein many Soviet republics embarked on their own paths toward statehood. The aspirations articulated by these republics were often steeped in the historical grievances of being subjected to Russian dominance and the desire to reclaim agency over their cultural and political destinies.

The dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 marked a significant turning point, ushering in the re-emergence of numerous independent states that had sought to assert their national identities. Countries like Ukraine, the Baltic states, and the Caucasian republics fought to disentangle their post-Soviet identities from the lingering legacy of Russian influence. The fervent nationalism that surged during this period demonstrated that, despite decades of efforts to foster a pan-Soviet identity, deep-rooted cultural identities could not be wholly extinguished. Instead, they resurfaced as emblems of resistance against the historical dominance by the Russian state.

In contemporary Russia, nationalism remains a potent force, reawakened in the post-Soviet context. Individual ethnic identities still possess substantial significance, often shaping relations between the Russian Federation and its minority republics. The Kremlin has at times sought to co-opt expressions of nationalism, using patriotic rhetoric to bolster its legitimacy while trying to mitigate ethnic tensions. However, Russian nationalism has also manifested in ways that reflect an exclusionary ideology, often targeting non-Russian communities and complicating the fragile balance of unity within the federation.

The legacy of Lenin and Stalin serves as a reminder of the intricate and often contradictory relationship between nationalism and the pursuit of unity. While Lenin's vision of Soviet unity surfaced from a noble desire for cooperation among the oppressed, Stalin's reappropriation of Russian nationalism revealed the precarious balance that is fraught with historical discord. The endurance of Russian nationalism following the disintegration of the Soviet Union illustrates that national identities cannot be reconciled or suppressed through ideology alone. The rich tapestry of ethnic identities within Russia and its former republics continues to challenge the narratives of supremacy and superiority that have long defined the political landscape, emphasizing a lasting complexity that endures even amidst the aspirations for unity. The persistent reality is one where both cultural identities and historical grievances shape the fabric of contemporary politics in ways that remain as vital and dynamic as ever.
