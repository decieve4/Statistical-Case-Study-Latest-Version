Moses Finley, a prominent classical historian, proposed a framework for understanding what constitutes a "genuine slave society." His criteria hinge on several key characteristics, including the economic reliance on slavery, the social structure that prioritizes wealth accumulation through slave labor, and the cultural attitudes that normalize and institutionalize this form of labor. The glittering city-states of the Persian Gulf, characterized by their rapid urbanization, substantial economic development, and reliance on various forms of labor, can be examined through this lens to establish whether they fulfill Finley’s criteria. 

In the context of the Persian Gulf, city-states such as Dubai, Doha, and Abu Dhabi stand out due to their revolutionary economic transformation over recent decades. These city-states have emerged as vibrant hubs of commerce, finance, tourism, and trade, leveraging vast reserves of oil and gas. The economic models that drive these cities often rely heavily on migrant labor, with a significant portion of the workforce comprising expatriate workers from South Asia, Southeast Asia, and other regions. Although the labor dynamics differ from those of ancient slave societies, they echo aspects of Finley’s criteria, particularly regarding economic structure. 

A crucial aspect of Finley’s argument is that slave societies depend on forced labor for their economic viability. In the Persian Gulf city-states, while there is no formal system of slavery akin to that of ancient Greece or Rome, the treatment of migrant workers has drawn parallels to exploitative labor practices. Workers frequently face restrictive labor conditions, low wages, and limited rights. Many enter the Gulf under sponsorship arrangements, which bind them to their employers, effectively reducing their freedom of movement and choice. The economic systems of these city-states, fueled by the energy sector and construction booms, can thus be seen as reliant on a marginalized and exploited labor force, reflecting Finley’s observation about the economic imperatives driving genuine slave societies.

Social structure is another cornerstone of Finley’s criteria, which emphasizes the stratification based on wealth and labor sources. In the contemporary Persian Gulf city-states, a clear hierarchy exists, delineating the lives of citizens from expatriates. Nationals enjoy a range of privileges, including access to significant state benefits, land ownership, and participation in political processes, while migrant workers often reside in labor camps, isolated from the general population. This stratification is reminiscent of ancient societies where citizens held rights and privileges denied to slaves or non-citizens. The stark contrast between the lifestyles of wealthy nationals and low-paid expatriate workers reinforces the class divisions observed in classical slave societies.

However, the notion of citizenship in these contextually modern societies complicates the straightforward application of Finley’s criteria. In cities like Dubai, the status of being a citizen versus a foreign worker creates a dichotomy that resembles the master-slave relationship. The social narrative constructed around citizenship reinforces notions of exclusivity and privilege, while simultaneously normalizing the disenfranchisement of migrant laborers. Those expatriates who power the economy are essential yet invisible, paralleling how ancient slave societies functioned with the physical absence of the enslaved from the social and political spheres of their society.

Cultural attitudes play a vital role in understanding genuine slave societies, as dictated by Finley. In the Persian Gulf, prevailing cultural norms reflect a blend of traditional Arab values and modern capitalist practices. While these city-states showcase a façade of opulence and modernity, the treatment of migrant workers often reveals a contradictory undercurrent rooted in long-standing views on labor and class. The perception of certain jobs as "beneath" nationals perpetuates the socio-economic reliance on foreign labor while justifying their subjugation in the labor hierarchy. This cultural framing resonates with historical contexts where the dehumanization of enslaved populations enabled their exploitation.

Additionally, the legal frameworks within these city-states provide insight into contemporary forms of dependency that echo Finley’s analysis. Work visa systems that tie workers to their employers create a precarious existence, reminiscent of ancient contracts of servitude. Workers are often subjected to laws that offer minimal incentives for employers to treat them equitably. The institutionalization of these disparities in rights and protections signifies a structural underpinning to the labor force's exploitation, reinforcing the idea that economic systems thrive on underlying inequalities.

In summary, while the Persian Gulf city-states do not have formalized systems of chattel slavery, the essential elements described by Moses Finley concerning economic dependence on unfree labor, societal stratification, and cultural rationalizations are present. The vibrant urban environments of Dubai, Doha, and Abu Dhabi, with their staggering skylines and luxurious amenities, mask the systematic exploitation of a labor force that sustains their glitzy façades. As nations navigate the complexities of globalization and economic diversification, the parallels to genuine slave societies provoke critical reflections on the morality of labor practices, citizenship, and the ways a society builds its prosperity on the backs of the marginalized. 

The legacy of these conditions affects not only those directly involved but also the broader social contract within these city-states, reinforcing intrinsic inequalities that echo through modern socio-economic realities. Considering Finley’s criteria enables a deeper understanding of the dialectical relationships that exist between wealth, labor exploitation, and social recognition in contemporary Persian Gulf society, opening up discussions about what constitutes freedom and equity in an age defined by rapid modernization juxtaposed against historical patterns of labor.
