The concept of nature conservation has long been intertwined with ideals of pristine wilderness—untouched landscapes existing in a state free from human influence. This perspective reveres ecosystems that appear to be in their natural state, often romanticizing the idea of untouched beauty amid the hustle of urban life. However, this obsession with pristine environments can be counterproductive in achieving real conservation goals, as it often dismisses the complex and messy realities of current ecosystems which are products of human history. The need for a paradigm shift in conservation thinking is urgent; instead, we must embrace the hybrid and dynamic landscapes resulting from centuries of human activity and intervention.

To begin with, the fixation on the pristine has deeply influenced the way conservation efforts are planned and executed. Protected areas are frequently designated based on their perceived naturalness, which creates the illusion that only unspoiled habitats are worthy of conservation. Let us consider national parks and reserves, where the narrative often centers around protecting landscapes that are deemed untouched by civilization. This leads to the exclusion or marginalization of areas where human influence is evident, regardless of their ecological value. For instance, urban greenspaces, agricultural lands, and even brownfields are regularly regarded as lesser states of nature, despite their potential to support biodiversity and serve as important ecological systems. By focusing primarily on pristine environments, we may overlook the biodiversity found in modified landscapes that have been ecologically managed or shaped by human activity over generations.

Moreover, the fixation on pristine nature creates a false dichotomy between natural and unnatural, further complicating conservation efforts. The reality is that ecosystems evolve and are continuously influenced by a myriad of factors including climate change, invasive species, and human land-use practices. The belief that nature can exist in a vacuum without human influence is not only misleading but detrimental. In practice, the landscapes we inhabit today often reflect both natural processes and human actions. Many ecosystems have developed through coevolution with humans, such as the traditional agricultural practices that have shaped the Italian terraced landscapes or the cultural landscapes of the Alhambra. These areas, rich in both biodiversity and cultural history, exemplify the intricate interplay between people and nature. Acknowledging these woven narratives enriches conservation practices and enables a more comprehensive understanding of nature's resilience.

Expanding the focus of conservation to include the "mongrel world" means recognizing the value of human-altered landscapes, where biodiversity flourishes alongside anthropogenic influences. Urban areas, for example, can provide essential habitats for various species. Research shows that cities can support wildlife populations, highlighting how diverse environments can exist amid concrete and steel. The acceptance of such dynamics presents opportunities to design cities in ways that enhance biodiversity, such as creating green roofs, planting native vegetation, and designing wildlife corridors.

Additionally, it is essential to challenge our perception of what constitutes successful conservation. Efforts should move beyond a binary model of success defined solely by the return to an idealized "pristine" state, to one that acknowledges adaptive management, resilience, and ecological integrity in various contexts. Rather than measuring success by the absence of human intervention, effectiveness should be evaluated on the health and functioning of ecosystems, with an understanding of their historical context. We should embrace adaptive management and promote interventions that guide ecosystems toward resilience, irrespective of their current state. This shift would encourage creative approaches that find harmony between biodiversity protection and responsible land-use practices.

Critics may argue that accepting a more dynamic view of nature could lead to complacency in conservation practices, potentially legitimizing destructive behaviors under the guise of acceptance. However, this perspective does not conflict with the need for stringent policies protecting biodiversity and ecosystems. Instead, by recognizing the value that anthropogenic spaces can hold, conservation strategies become more inclusive and pragmatic, expanding the scope of action to promote a variety of natural environments rather than a singular ideal of wilderness purity. This embodies a more holistic appreciation for nature that does not diminish efforts to conserve critical habitats but instead acknowledges that conceiving of nature only through a lens of pristine environments misses broader ecological truths.

Learning to love this mongrel world allows society to reframe conservation narratives in ways that are authentically grounded. This requires valuing places that may not fit traditional definitions of beauty but are nonetheless rich in ecosystem services, biodiversity, and cultural significance. It invites a more nuanced discourse about the interconnectedness of human and natural systems, fostering an ethic of stewardship that embraces complexity rather than simplification.

Ultimately, the movement towards a more inclusive and realistic approach in conservation requires a cultural shift—one that replaces the idealization of pristine landscapes with an appreciation for the diverse and hybrid realities emerging within various ecosystems. By focusing less on an unattainable ideal and more on the complexities of multi-layered landscapes, we can develop conservation strategies that are effective and relevant in a rapidly changing world. The essence of nature is not solely in its untouched grandeur but in its capacity to adapt, to evolve, and to coexist with humanity. In this reconciliation lies both opportunity and necessity—an imperative to foster resilient ecosystems that thrive in the intricate and intertwined realms of the natural and the human-made. Embracing this understanding requires humility, creativity, and an open heart, for in recognizing the beauty inherent in our shared environment, we can cultivate a more sustainable and inclusive vision for conservation in our ever-changing world.
