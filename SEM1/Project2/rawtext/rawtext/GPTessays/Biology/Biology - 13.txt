In our everyday experiences, we navigate a world filled with a variety of entities that hold different statuses of existence. A cat, with its whiskers twitching, eyes gleaming with curiosity, and the egregious habit of demanding attention at the most inconvenient times, embodies the essence of life. Conversely, a sofa—a fixture in homes, a place to sit and relax—remains inanimate, devoid of feelings, thoughts, or aspirations. This dichotomy between the living and the non-living may seem straightforward, yet the interplay of these entities offers profound insights into the nature of life and existence. Delving into information theory provides a unique lens through which we can explore this relationship, revealing how both the living and the non-living are interconnected within the larger framework of our universe.

Information theory, a field established by Claude Shannon in the mid-20th century, centers on the quantification, storage, and communication of information. At its core, it examines how data can be transferred efficiently, exploring concepts such as entropy, redundancy, and channels of communication. These principles can be applied to highlight the relationship between living beings and their non-living environments, such as the interaction between a cat and its sofa. The key element here is that while the cat is alive and actively processes information—responding to stimuli, navigating its environment, and interacting with other beings—the sofa occupies a different role: that of a passive participant in the symphony of life unfolding around it.

A living being like a cat thrives on information intake, driven by biological imperatives: seeking food, avoiding danger, and finding companionship. It interacts with its environment, assessing the sofa not just as an object, but as a space filled with potential meanings. Perhaps it serves as a lookout perch, a warm sleeping nook, or a play area with dangling threads and cushions to conquer. The sofa, then, becomes more than just a piece of furniture; it transforms into part of the cat’s ecosystem, a bounded space where interactions occur. In this sense, the sofa embodies what information theory refers to as 'channels' through which meaning and data are exchanged, even if the objects themselves do not possess life. Information is constantly flowing in this interaction: the cat learns about the sofa, its textures, its smells, and its role in the cat's daily life.

When we consider the concept of entropy in information theory, it initially refers to the amount of uncertainty or disorder within a system. For a living being like a cat, its experiences create a landscape rich with information, enabling it to navigate the world effectively. Yet, the introduction of a non-living entity like the sofa into this environment adds layers of structure and predictability. The sofa represents a form of organization, serving as a stable reference point in an otherwise dynamic universe. It bears witness to the living actions around it—each scratch of the cat's claws, each leap onto its cushions, and each cozy nap taken upon it—thus participating vicariously in the cat's existence.

Further deepening our exploration, we can examine the redundancy present in living beings and their interactions with inanimate objects. Redundancy in information theory refers to the inclusion of extra or repeated information wherein some data serves as a backup in case of errors. In the context of our cat and sofa scenario, we see redundancy manifest in the cat’s behavior—its repeated interactions with the sofa reinforce its knowledge of the space it occupies. Each leap, scratch, and curl into the sofa lends itself to the redundancy of experience; the cat gains confidence about the environment, understanding its boundaries and behaviors associated with that object.

Another remarkable dimension of our inquiry relates to the concept of feedback loops—an integral principle in information theory. Feedback occurs when the output of a system is circled back as an input, leading to self-regulation and adaptation. The cat's relationship with its sofa epitomizes this loop. When the cat jumps onto the sofa and feels the comfort of the cushions, it reinforces a positive association. If it scratches the fabric and discovers a texture that is both satisfying and expressive of its territorial instincts, it learns that this object can serve multiple purposes. This interplay continues, creating a complex web of information shared between a living being and an inanimate object, whereby each action generates new data that informs future interactions.

While a sofa is non-living and devoid of consciousness, it does not exist in isolation. It contributes to a living context, shaping experiences, facilitating connections, and forming memories. A cat may not perceive the sofa in the same way as it perceives another cat, but the sofa still plays a pivotal role in shaping the cat’s life narrative. Everyday encounters with this object evoke a spectrum of emotions—comfort, security, and perhaps a hint of mischief when it comes to clawing at those tempting pillows. The presence of the sofa is a testament to the trivial yet profound ways in which non-living entities contribute to the rich tapestry of life.

This synergy between the living and the non-living invites a broader contemplation on existence itself. If we view life through the lens of information flow and interaction, it becomes evident that living beings are not merely individual entities; they are part of a larger community of relationships that span across various forms of matter. Informational exchanges shape our world, revealing how all objects and beings, regardless of their living status, coexist and cooperate in dynamic ways. 

As we peel back the layers of our everyday interactions, we discover that a cat and a sofa, although fundamentally different in their states of being, exemplify the intricate dance of information theory. Together, they navigate the continuum of existence, illustrating that while life is undoubtedly vibrant and filled with the essence of sentience, the inanimate also encodes meaning through its relationship with the living. Thus, as we ponder the nature of life, we must also embrace the myriad ways through which non-living objects participate in our human—and feline—experience, deepening our understanding of existence in an interconnected universe.
