In contemporary political discourse, the term "neoliberalism" has often emerged as a pejorative, particularly among left-leaning intellectuals, activists, and policymakers. This shift reveals not only a change in how the term is conceptualized but also highlights a broader critique of liberalism itself. Not too long ago, liberalism was synonymous with progress, freedom, and the promise of democracy, appealing to people across the political spectrum. However, the warming embrace of capitalism that characterized the latter part of the 20th century, often branded as neoliberalism, has led to profound disenchantment from those who originally identified with liberal ideals. As such, the question arises: in a political climate rife with skepticism towards neoliberal policies, will anyone genuinely claim the mantle of liberalism?

To understand this dynamic, it is important to first delineate what is meant by neoliberalism. Rooted in classical liberal principles, neoliberalism advocates for free markets, deregulation, and a minimal role for the state in economic affairs. This philosophy gained traction in the late 20th century, emerging in response to the economic crises of the 1970s as governments sought to revitalize flagging economies through market-based strategies. Prominent figures such as Margaret Thatcher in the UK and Ronald Reagan in the US epitomized this shift, implementing policies that emphasized fiscal austerity, privatization, and globalization. While these policies initially appeared to spur economic growth, they also engendered significant disparities in wealth and localized social discontent. The focus on individualism over collective welfare and economic freedom over social justice began to alienate many, especially as the promises of increased prosperity and opportunity remained unevenly distributed.

As neoliberalism took hold, it came to be associated increasingly with societal ills, from economic inequality to environmental degradation. Critics argue that the neoliberal agenda often sidelines marginalized communities, leaving many without access to essential resources. In this context, the left's embrace of the term "neoliberal" as a derogatory label reflects both a rejection of these policies and an effort to realign political discourse with values of equity and social justice. The term has become shorthand for a range of grievances, including job precarity, wage stagnation, and the debilitating effects of austerity measures. For many on the left, the neoliberal mantra of “there is no alternative” has transformed into a call for reimagining political and economic systems through a more equitable lens. 

In response, we have witnessed a resurgence of interest in alternative frameworks that seek to restore the social contract that neoliberalism has eroded. This includes movements advocating for a renewed commitment to social welfare programs, universal healthcare, tuition-free education, and workers' rights. These initiatives represent a departure from the neoliberal consensus and signal a yearning for a politics that prioritizes human dignity over unchecked market forces. The renewed energy in social movements, as seen in the labor uprisings, climate justice protests, and demands for racial equality, highlights a desire to reclaim liberalism from the clutches of neoliberalism while also challenging the limitations of traditional leftist politics.

However, embracing a reinvigorated form of liberalism poses challenges. The legacy of neoliberalism has led to a politicization of the term "liberal" itself, leading some to view it with suspicion. Within this climate, the very identity of liberalism remains contested. Critics, even from the left, often describe liberalism as inherently flawed. They argue that liberalism's historical roots are intertwined with colonialism, imperialism, and a capitalist framework that necessitates oppressing certain groups to benefit others. This critique complicates any attempt to reclaim a notion of liberalism solely defined by its classical roots of freedom and equality. The racial, economic, and gender injustices disproportionately affecting marginalized communities highlight the inadequacies of a brand of liberalism that treats equality as a purely abstract ideal, often overlooking the lived experiences of those grappling with systemic inequities.

Furthermore, the rise of authoritarianism, populism, and anti-liberal sentiments complicates the future of liberalism. The resurgence of nationalistic sentiments—marked by leaders who resonate with anti-establishment rhetoric—poses a formidable challenge to all variants of liberalism. When political narratives focus on division, fear, and exclusion, there is little space for dialogue about shared values such as pluralism, tolerance, and respect for diversity—the cornerstones of liberal thought. Consequently, for those who might claim a renewed liberal legacy, navigating the tension between the ideals of liberalism and the very real issues of disenchantment with the current political order is a formidable task.

Critically, to move forward, proponents of a modern liberalism must grapple with its contradictions and engage with the critiques put forth by both leftists and right-wing populists. This engagement necessitates a robust reexamination of what it means to be liberal in an age characterized by economic disparity, social upheaval, and climate crisis. Progressive forces within liberalism could find common ground on issues such as income inequality, climate justice, and the protection of democracy, crafting a vision that eschews neoliberal dogma for a more inclusive and socially conscious approach to governance. 

Moreover, any talk of reclaiming liberalism must be accompanied by an earnest examination of power dynamics, ensuring the voices of historically marginalized groups are forefronted in the conversation. Feminist, anti-racist, and environmental perspectives must be integrated into a renewed vision of liberalism that challenges the neoliberal orthodoxy and addresses the complex interplay of identity, equity, and justice. Particularly in a global context where movements for decolonization and human rights are gaining momentum, the failure to adapt to these changing narratives risks leaving liberalism irredeemably tarnished and maligned.

In essence, the political landscape is ripe for the reclamation and revitalization of liberal ideals—if not as pure liberalism, then as a synthesis that honors its legacy while infusing it with social justice, community well-being, and environmental sustainability. While many may shun the label of liberal in the face of neoliberal critiques, the challenge may ultimately lie in forging a new understanding of what liberalism can mean in this age of transformation. It can no longer be viewed merely as a market-driven philosophy or an abstract set of principles but rather as a living, breathing framework attuned to the realities of contemporary society, one that genuinely promotes equity, dignity, and community for all. Whether anyone will genuinely claim the banner of liberalism remains uncertain, but if it aspires to be relevant in the 21st century, it must evolve beyond its past failings and embrace a future that honors its foundational ideals in a way that resonates with a diverse and changing world.
