In the depths of my struggle with depression, I often found myself trapped in a seemingly never-ending cycle of despair, where every day felt like an uphill battle. It was during this dark chapter of my life that I stumbled upon the writings of an English priest, Thomas Merton, whose profound insights on Buddhism and spirituality began to guide me toward a path of healing and enlightenment.

Merton, a Trappist monk, became one of the most influential voices in bringing Eastern philosophies to a Western audience in the mid-20th century. His works encapsulated not only his theological knowledge but also his deep understanding of the human condition. As I delved into his writings, I discovered a treasure trove of wisdom that resonated with my struggles and offered me a new lens through which to view my pain.

One of the first passages that struck me was Merton's exploration of solitude and contemplation. In a world cluttered with distractions and noise, he emphasized the importance of taking time for oneself. This idea might seem simple, but for someone mired in depression, it offered a lifeline. He articulated the need to disconnect from external chaos and turn inward—a task that felt daunting but necessary. By allowing myself moments of solitude to reflect on my thoughts and emotions, I began to cultivate a deeper understanding of my inner landscape. This was not about escaping my feelings but rather confronting them with compassion and openness.

As I immersed myself in his reflections on mindfulness—a concept intrinsically tied to Buddhism—I recognized how much of my suffering stemmed from dwelling on the past and fretting about the future. Merton wrote about the transformative power of being fully present in each moment, a realization that acted as a gentle reminder that the present is all we truly possess. I began to integrate mindfulness techniques into my daily routine, focusing on my breath, observing my surroundings, and letting go of judgments. These practices created a sanctuary within me—a space where I could acknowledge my struggles without being overwhelmed by them.

Merton also eloquently articulated the idea of interconnectedness, a fundamental principle in both Buddhism and the broader human experience. He spoke about the threads that bind us all together, transcending our individual woes. In my solitary moments of despair, I had often felt isolated and alone, convinced that my pain was uniquely mine to bear. However, as I embraced Merton's insights, I began to realize that my experiences were part of a shared human tapestry. This perspective ignited a spark of empathy within me, allowing me to view my suffering not as a personal burden but as a common thread in the vast narrative of human existence. Connecting with this larger fabric offered solace and the reassuring understanding that I was not alone in my struggle.

Importantly, Merton's writings on self-compassion became a beacon of hope for me. He stressed the necessity of treating oneself with kindness, especially in moments of despair. I had been my own harshest critic, berating myself for my perceived failures and shortcomings. Through Merton's words, I learned to soften that stance, to recognize the beauty in imperfection and the strength in vulnerability. He proposed that embracing our flaws and allowing ourselves to be human is not only acceptable but essential to the healing process. This shift in perspective was liberating, providing me with the permission to experience my emotions without judgment and to acknowledge that healing is not linear.

As my understanding deepened, I began to explore Merton's appreciation for the beauty of nature—a recurring theme in his writings. He highlighted nature's ability to ground us, serving as a reminder of our place in the world. In my moments of despair, I often confined myself indoors, shunning the outside world. However, inspired by Merton's reverence for the natural elements, I decided to venture outside, even if just for a brief walk. The crisp air, rustling leaves, and fleeting moments of sunlight moved me in unexpected ways. Nature became an anchor, a source of tranquility that eased some of the burdens I carried. It was during these walks that I felt the weight of my depression somewhat lift, if only temporarily, leaving me with glimpses of clarity and hope.

Merton's perspective on impermanence also served as a soothing balm during my darkest days. Understanding that all feelings, including despair, are transient was a transformative realization. He wrote about the fleeting nature of existence, and how every moment is both an ending and a new beginning. This concept of impermanence became a guiding principle in my healing journey, helping me to see my depression not as an insurmountable wall but rather as a chapter in an ongoing story. This shift in perception empowered me to take proactive steps toward recovery, reminding me that even the darkest moments would eventually give way to light.

Throughout my journey, I also discovered that Merton’s advocacy for social justice and the importance of compassion toward others were integral to both his philosophy and my healing. Engaging with the world around me and extending kindness to others transformed my perspective. Volunteering and participating in community activities connected me with people who shared similar struggles, creating a sense of solidarity that further alleviated my feelings of isolation. Merton's emphasis on compassion—toward oneself and others—provided a pathway to purpose and meaning, reminding me that healing could be a collective experience. 

As I continue to reflect on my personal journey, I am immensely grateful for the writings of Thomas Merton. His insights into solitude, mindfulness, interconnectedness, self-compassion, the beauty of nature, impermanence, and compassion toward others have offered me the tools and understanding I needed to navigate the labyrinth of my mind. While my journey out of depression may not be complete, I now possess a compassionate framework through which I can view my struggles, a light that guides me through the darkness.

In many ways, Merton’s teachings resonate deeply within me, serving as a constant reminder that healing is an evolving path, rich with lessons and discoveries. I have learned to honor my struggles as part of my story, and to approach each day with newfound intention and grace. With Merton’s voice accompanying me, I am learning not just to cope with my depression but to find meaning and purpose amid it, and to embrace the journey of becoming the fullest version of myself.
