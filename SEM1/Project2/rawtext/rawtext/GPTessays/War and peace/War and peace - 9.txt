The American narrative often presents itself as a paradox, intricately woven with themes of exceptionalism, morality, and the justification of violence. Over the past four centuries, Americans have engaged in a complex dialogue around the legitimacy of their violent actions while simultaneously condemning the violence enacted by others. This dichotomy can be traced through various historical contexts, where violent acts are rationalized as necessary for the pursuit of liberty, justice, or national security, while the violent actions of others are often painted as expressions of barbarism.

From the initial encounters between European settlers and Indigenous peoples, the foundation of American violence was laid. The colonists viewed themselves as bringers of civilization, seeking to cultivate and ‘civilize’ what they perceived as a savage land inhabited by barbaric tribes. This narrative helped to justify their displacement, subjugation, and extermination of Native populations. The violence perpetrated by settlers was framed as a form of survival and progress, motivated by divine providence or a manifest destiny. In contrast, Indigenous resistance to colonization was depicted as brutish and irrational, reinforcing the perception that their struggles against invasion were not grounded in legitimate grievances but rather in an inherent barbarism.

As the nation expanded, this paradigm of justifying violence continued to evolve. The American Revolution serves as a prime example where violence was not only seen as justified but also noble. American colonists, asserting their rights against British rule, engaged in violence as a means of attaining freedom. This revolutionary violence was framed as a fight for liberty, democracy, and justice, presenting American rebels as heroic figures resisting tyranny. Here, the violence was not merely permissible; it was celebrated as a necessary step in achieving a just and moral society. Conversely, when the British or any other foreign power exhibited violence, it was often characterized as oppressive, cruel, and barbaric, marking a clear moral division between the legitimate violence of 'freedom fighters' and the inhumane violence of tyrants.

The Civil War further illustrates the complexities of justifying violence within the American context. Both the Union and the Confederacy laid claim to moral high ground through their cause, with each side believing that their violent struggle was justified. The Union's fight against slavery, though riddled with its own violent realities and political struggles, was framed as a moral imperative, while the Confederacy’s defense of states' rights was often shrouded in euphemisms about ‘freedom’ and ‘heritage.’ In the aftermath of the war, the Union’s actions during Reconstruction, including the use of military force to suppress insurrections and enforce new laws, continued to draw upon this notion of justified violence perpetrated for the greater good, contrasting starkly with the violent responses from Southern white supremacy, which were branded as savage and systemic.

The ideological expansion of the United States across the continent, often referred to as Manifest Destiny, also highlighted this duality of perception toward violence. The United States justifiably waged war against Mexico in the 1840s, positing that the acquisition of territory was a divine right and a necessary step for progress. The violence of the Mexican government and its military were depicted as aggressive and uncivilized. Similarly, the government employed acts of violence against Indigenous peoples to facilitate westward expansion, all while portraying these actions as part of a righteous mission to civilize and develop the land. The derived narratives consistently painted the aggressors in a positive light while vilifying the resistance, thus perpetuating the cycle of justifying American violence while dismissing others as barbaric.

In the 20th century, this trend continued through American foreign interventions and wars. The justification for wartime violence, particularly during conflicts like World War I and II, was often wrapped in rhetoric of defending democracy and freedom. The violence unleashed upon enemies was described as necessary for stopping tyranny and fascism. However, when similar violent actions were exhibited by countries such as Vietnam, Iraq, or various nations during the Cold War, the narratives around those actions were starkly different. These nations were typecast as aggressors and their violence was decried as barbarism, regardless of the complexities of their motivations or the historical contexts. This selective moral framework applied to violence creates a distinct inconsistency—a hallmark of American discourse surrounding justified violence.

Thus, throughout American history, there exists a continued tension between the perception of justified violence and the labeling of others' violence as barbaric. This inconsistency reflects deeper socio-political ideologies that underpin American identity. While individual acts of violence may arise from deeply rooted cultural, political, or economic sources, the American narrative tends to filter these actions through a lens of prestige and justification when Americans are the perpetrators. This pattern fosters a kind of moral exceptionalism, where American intentions are routinely viewed as noble and positions of power are maintained despite the very real consequences of violent actions on human lives.

Moreover, this legacy of justified violence versus perceived barbarism resonates in contemporary discussions around policing, military actions, and international interventions. The rhetoric surrounding domestic protests and the responses by law enforcement showcases this enduring dichotomy. When protesters expressing discontent with systemic injustices resort to violence or property damage, these acts are often condemned and labeled as lawless or barbaric. In contrast, the violence that erupts from state mechanisms—often under the guise of maintaining order or protecting citizens—continues to be framed as a necessary evil, protecting the very fabric of society.

In conclusion, for over 400 years, the American justification of violence has existed alongside the view of others' violence as barbarism. This troubling dichotomy reveals not only the inconsistencies of moral reasoning but also a societies proclivity to engage in violence while maintaining an ideological framework of righteousness. The legacies of colonialism, war, and state violence echo deeply in the contemporary landscape, suggesting that until there is a reckoning with this historical narrative, the cycle of justification will perpetuate through generations. The challenge lies in transcending this binary perspective and recognizing that the humanity of all individuals, regardless of their geography or societal standing, must be acknowledged in any discourse surrounding violence and moral justifications. Only through such critical engagement can a genuine dialogue towards understanding and reconciliation begin to take shape.
