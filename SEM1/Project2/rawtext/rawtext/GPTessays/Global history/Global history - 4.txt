The concept of geopolitics has gained significant prominence as a framework for understanding international relations and the power dynamics between states. Its origins, however, can be traced back to the responses of German and Russian scholars and political leaders to historical defeats and the subsequent desire to regain influence. This essay explores the development of geopolitics, notably in the context of Germany and Russia, both of which sought to reinterpret their national identities and positions in the international arena after facing significant challenges and losses.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, following a series of military setbacks and diplomatic failures, Germany began to grapple with its place on the world stage. The German defeat in World War I, coupled with the punitive conditions of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, forced a reevaluation of its national strategy. German intellectuals sought to explain their nation’s circumstances through new theoretical frameworks, ultimately giving birth to geopolitical thinking. Figures such as Friedrich Ratzel contributed greatly to this discourse, proposing that a nation’s power is influenced by its physical geography. Ratzel’s ideas aligned with Social Darwinism, suggesting that states were subject to international competition akin to biological organisms. This perspective inherently justified aggressive expansionism as a means for the rejuvenation of a nation perceived to be in decline.

Russian geopolitics developed in a similar vein. The upheaval following the Russian Revolution of 1917, compounded by the loss of territory after World War I, necessitated a rethinking of Russia's geopolitical position. The strategic concepts of figures such as Nikolai Spykman and Aleksandr Dugin emerged during this turbulent period. While Spykman accepted the geopolitical framework established by earlier theorists, he introduced the idea of the "Rimland" — the coastal fringes of Eurasia as crucial zones for power control. Dugin’s later contributions drew heavily from Eurasianism, positing that Russia had a unique role in the balance of global power due to its vast landmass and diverse cultural influences. This blend of geopolitical theories in Russia centers on the reassertion of influence, often framed as a civilizational duty.

The interwar period saw a flourishment of geopolitical thought in both countries as scholars framed their nations’ histories against a backdrop of territorial losses and the perceived encirclement by hostile powers. For Germany, the myth of "Lebensraum," or living space, became a central theme, asserting that the nation needed to expand eastward to ensure its survival and prosperity. This ideology was not just an explanation for past defeats but morphed into a blueprint for future territorial ambitions, culminating in the aggressive policies of the Nazi regime. By framing their need for expansion as a natural and necessary pursuit, German geopolitical thought sought to legitimize its militaristic approach and the annexation of neighboring territories.

Conversely, in post-revolutionary Russia, the geopolitical narrative was marked by feelings of vulnerability and resentment over the loss of the Tsarist Empire’s territories. The Bolshevik government, seeking to establish legitimacy and stability in a fragmented nation, articulated a vision of a resurgent Russia that would reclaim its standing through revolutionary ideology and territorial consolidation. The obsession with safeguarding the USSR’s borders against perceived threats, particularly from Western powers, further entrenched a geopolitical mindset that viewed conflict as a necessary component of national survival. This resulted in policies that prioritized expansion into Eastern Europe and Central Asia, generating both legitimacy and influence in the post-war order.

As both Germany and Russia sought to redefine their geopolitical strategies, their approaches were further influenced by the emergence of the Cold War. In this highly charged context, the United States and its allies competed with the Soviet Union for global supremacy. Each side interpreted geopolitical strategies through ideological lenses; the West emphasized democracy and capitalism, while the East leaned toward communism and autarky. The standoff led to a new understanding of geopolitical competition, with strategies often reflective of historical grievances and a deep-seated desire to reclaim influence lost through war and revolution.

The study of geopolitics thus became increasingly intertwined with national identity and narrative construction in both Germany and Russia. Geopolitical frameworks allowed leaders to position their countries on a path to recovery and resurgence. For Germany, particularly during the reunification period in the late 20th century, there was a revival of earlier geopolitical notions, albeit in a more nuanced form, emphasizing the importance of European integration and collaboration as a means to ensure stability and prevent the kind of nationalistic aggression that had led to past catastrophes. For Russia, the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 created a profound crisis of identity and influence. The subsequent resurgence under Vladimir Putin can be seen as a reaction to perceived Western encroachment and a response to historical grievances rooted in the loss of superpower status.

In recent years, the landscape of geopolitics has evolved, yet the thrust of the original German and Russian ideas continues to reverberate. Whether discussing the New Silk Road, NATO expansion, or energy politics, the echoes of historical defeat and the longing for reassertion fuel policies in both nations. This intricate relationship between the past and contemporary geopolitical strategies underscores the foundational belief that understanding one's geographical context is crucial to navigating the turbulent waters of international relations.

In conclusion, the concept of geopolitics as developed in Germany and Russia serves as a significant example of how nations articulate their ambitions and identities in the face of losses. Originating in a context of defeat, geopolitical thought reflects the attempt to reverse declines in influence through a reconfiguration of national narratives and strategies. Ultimately, the complexity of contemporary geopolitics must be understood in light of these historical grievances, providing insight not only into the actions of these nations but also the broader dynamics that shape the global order today. The legacy of such geopolitical ideologies remains potent, highlighting how the past continues to influence the present in the global arena.
