Antisemitism, a term that denotes hostility or prejudice against Jews, has deep historical roots that intertwine with economic, social, and political changes. In the early modern world, particularly from the 16th to the 18th centuries, the emergence and expansion of finance capitalism played a pivotal role in shaping societal attitudes towards Jewish communities. The rise of finance capitalism brought with it abstract economic concepts and practices that unsettled traditional social structures, and in response, antisemitic sentiments began to flourish. This growth can be understood through several intertwined themes: the transformation of economic practices, the stereotype of the Jewish moneylender, the scapegoating of Jewish populations during economic crises, and the larger geopolitical shifts that affected Jewish communities across Europe.

At the heart of this discussion is the transformation of economic practices during the early modern period. The introduction of new financial instruments, such as bills of exchange, letters of credit, and the burgeoning stock markets, led to a dramatic shift in how wealth was created and managed. This transition was often accompanied by a growing sense of abstraction; money began to exist more as a concept rather than a physical object. Unlike the agrarian economies that had previously dominated, where wealth was tied to land and labor, finance capitalism allowed for more fluid, speculative investments that could be detached from tangible resources. In this new economic landscape, traditional Christian moralities around wealth and its accumulation were challenged. In many instances, these shifts became a source of insecurity for non-Jewish populations who witnessed Jews taking a more prominent role in these emerging financial sectors.

The association of Jews with moneylending can be traced back to medieval Europe, where restrictions prevented Jews from owning land, compelling them to engage in trade and finance. Jewish moneylenders became vital to the medieval economy, providing essential credit to Christians who were often barred from charging interest on loans due to religious prohibitions. This established a complicated relationship built on both dependency and resentment. As finance capitalism expanded, stereotypes around the Jewish moneylender resurfaced and evolved, portraying Jews as greedy and manipulative.

These stereotypes were perpetuated through literature, art, and public discourse, reinforcing negative images of Jews as exploitative figures who thrived on the misfortune of others. The literature of the time often depicted Jewish characters in villainous roles, exacerbating societal fear and mistrust. This cultural milieu, coupled with the actual economic shifts, created a fertile ground for antisemitic ideologies to gain traction. Jews became the proverbial ‘other,’ embodying traits that were increasingly linked with the unsettling realities of capitalist excess and systemic inequality. Economic transformations that unsettled social hierarchies further intensified this othering, as Jews were perceived to be both beneficiaries and manipulators of the new financial order.

The antisemitic reactions to economic instability were also pronounced during periods of crisis, such as famines, wars, and financial downturns. Economic hardship often breeds scapegoating, and Jewish communities frequently found themselves blamed for larger systemic failures. The inability of authorities to provide tangible explanations for economic crises led to a tendency to look for external culprits. In many regions, Jews became convenient scapegoats, accused of hoarding wealth, profiting from others’ suffering, and causing economic disruption. In such contexts, historical grievances and prejudices were revived, leading to waves of violence against Jewish populations, including expulsions, pogroms, and systematic discrimination.

Furthermore, the early modern world was characterized by significant geopolitical shifts, including the rise of nation-states and the formation of national identities. As countries sought to delineate their boundaries and consolidate power, Jews were often excluded from the national narrative. This exclusion was framed around the notion of citizenship and economic contribution. With the rise of finance capitalism, the characteristics of who belonged to the nation became linked to economic success and moral behavior, contributing to the perception that Jews, who had thrived in these environments, were still outsiders. This intersection of economic competition, national identity, and traditional antisemitic tropes fueled a hostile environment that further marginalized Jewish communities.

At the same time, the Enlightenment began to reshape discussions around reason, ethics, and societal organization. Yet, even within such progressive movements, Jews were often viewed through a lens of irrationality or superstition, further complicating their place in society. Notably, Jewish emancipation began to emerge as a philosophical ideal, promising inclusion based on merit rather than background. However, the reality was far more complex, as internal societal conflicts regarding Jewish identity and place in the economic landscape persisted. The promise of economic opportunity for some Jews often came hand-in-hand with resentment from others, reinforcing consumeristic and competitive feelings that had antisemitism at their core.

As Jews became more entrenched in the financial systems, they also began to play significant roles in the development of national banks and stock exchanges, particularly in England and the Netherlands. While these accomplishments illustrated Jewish adaptability and resilience, they simultaneously heightened existing animosities. Some gentiles focused on their successes as evidence of an unholy alliance between Jews and the new capitalist systems, further perpetuating conspiracy theories about Jewish control over finance. This period of history effectively illustrates how the growth and complexity of finance capitalism were mirrored by a rise in organized antisemitism, feeding into a broader narrative of competition and cultural conflict.

The unsettling, abstract growth of finance capitalism in the early modern world created a unique socioeconomic framework wherein traditional beliefs, structures, and prejudices were reassessed and often manipulated. Antisemitism, in this context, flourished as a social response to these rapid changes, providing a convenient outlet for frustration and insecurity. In doing so, it not only reflected prevailing economic anxieties but also became a tool of exclusion that defined social identities in increasingly competitive environments. The historical patterns of antisemitism during this era exemplify how societal shifts can give rise to prejudice, illustrating a cycle of exclusion that can persist long after the socioeconomic conditions that birthed it are altered. Understanding these underlying dynamics is crucial as societies navigate the complexity of identity, economics, and cultural narratives, reminding us that history can often repeat itself when old prejudices are activated by new realities.
