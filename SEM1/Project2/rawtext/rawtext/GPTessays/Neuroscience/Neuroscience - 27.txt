From the dawn of cinema, filmmakers have employed techniques that manipulate perception, creating art that transcends ordinary storytelling. This interplay between visual media and human cognition has profound implications, leading to a vivid exploration of how audiovisual experiences can shape emotions and thoughts. While our understanding of the brain and its processes continues to evolve, particularly within the realm of neuroscience, filmmakers have historically tapped into the laws of perception in innovative ways that sometimes outpace scientific comprehension. This dynamic relationship highlights not only the artistic potential of film but also invites a deeper examination of how our brains interpret these sensory inputs.

At the core of cinematic influence is the notion of visual perception, a complex interplay of light, motion, and context that filmmakers manipulate to evoke emotional and psychological responses. The concept of framing is often employed, which involves the strategic selection of what viewers see within a shot. By controlling the boundaries of the visual field, filmmakers can guide the audience's focus and influence their emotional journey. Take, for instance, the use of close-ups that capture the nuanced expressions of an actor's face. This practice invites viewers into an intimate connection with the character’s thoughts and emotions, allowing for empathy to flourish. In juxtaposition, wide shots can provide context to the character's environment, emphasizing isolation or grandeur. Scientists continue to investigate how such visual techniques modify brain activity and emotional engagement, yet filmmakers have, for generations, harnessed these visual elements—often unconsciously—crafting experiences that resonate on a primal level.

Besides framing, the concept of movement plays a critical role in shaping viewer perception. Cinematographers leverage pans, tilts, and tracking shots to create a sense of dynamism, engaging audiences in a narrative tapestry. The kinetic quality of film establishes rhythm and pace that mirrors music, tapping into deeply rooted neurological responses connected to movement and sound. For instance, when a camera follows a character down a corridor, viewers not only see but feel the pacing of the character’s emotions—anticipation, fear, or resolve. This ability to manipulate pacing, known as tempo, can elicit heightened arousal and suspense, akin to musical crescendos, long before scientific understanding elucidated the mechanisms through which these experiences occur. 

Lighting, another essential element of film, invokes profound shifts in perception and emotion. Filmmakers have harnessed the interplay of shadows and highlights to cast subjects in disparate lights, both literally and metaphorically. High-contrast lighting can evoke tension or danger, while softer lighting may suggest comfort or intimacy. This modulation of light creates an emotional landscape that engages the viewer beyond intellectual rationalization. Neurologists have conducted studies revealing how light impacts mood and cognitive function, yet artists have long exploited these principles in ways that connect with the audience viscerally. Cinematic lighting can guide the viewer's subconsciously recognized cues, triggering responses that may not yet be fully understood within the scientific community.

Sound design and scoring further amplify the role filmmakers play in shaping perception. The auditory landscape of a film encompasses dialogue, sound effects, and music, all elements that work synergistically with visuals. The phenomenon of "mise-en-scène" extends as much to sound as to image; the atmosphere created by auditory elements can profoundly alter how viewers perceive and interpret a scene. Music, in particular, acts as a powerful emotional catalyst—stirring feelings of nostalgia, excitement, or dread. Neuroscience has shown how music can activate brain regions associated with emotion and memory, yet filmmakers have adeptly wielded this technique to evoke specific emotional trajectories long before the processes at play were understood. The auditory elements of filmmaking integrate with visual stimuli to create a holistic sensory experience, suggesting that filmmakers tap into cognitive pathways still being unraveled by scientific inquiry.

Moreover, filmmakers explore narrative structures that challenge conventional perception, often employing techniques such as non-linear storytelling. While traditional narratives follow a linear progression, films like "Pulp Fiction" and "Inception" play with chronology and structure, encouraging audiences to engage more actively with the storyline. This engagement demands cognitive participation; viewers must piece together fragmented narratives, heightening their overall investment in the film. This relationship between interpretation and engagement leads to deeper emotional payoffs, emphasizing the ability of film to influence cognition and perception in ways that remain underexplored in neuroscientific research.

The impact of visual effects and virtual reality further extends the ways we understand perception in filmmaking. Technological advancements allow filmmakers to create vivid, immersive experiences that challenge the viewer's conventional sense of reality. The visceral engagement of audiences with CGI spectacles blurs the boundaries between the real and the imagined, tapping into fundamental psychological principles about marvel, fear, and awe. Virtual reality takes this further, offering a sensory experience that can affect perceptions of space and self, fostering empathy and new perspectives through direct immersion. Yet, the complex implications of these technologies combine neuroscience and art in ways that necessitate ongoing exploration and understanding.

Filmmakers, through their intricate artistry, have indulged in a dialogue with neuroscience that deepens our understanding of perception and experience. They skillfully manipulate visuals and auditory cues to engage and influence thoughts and emotions, operating in a realm that blends artistic intuition with intuitive psychological principles. While neuroscience continues to probe into the mechanisms that govern perception and emotion, the world of cinema has, for a long time, experimented with these very elements, crafting narratives and visuals that resonate with the human experience. As both fields evolve, the intersection of filmmaking and neuroscience offers rich possibilities for exploration, revealing a shared endeavor toward grasping the complexities of perception in shaping human experience. In a world still courting the mysteries of consciousness and perception, the artistry of filmmakers remains a powerful bridge to understanding the ever-fascinating capabilities of the human brain.
