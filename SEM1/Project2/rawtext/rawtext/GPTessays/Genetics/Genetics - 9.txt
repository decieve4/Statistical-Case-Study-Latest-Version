The concept of 'designer humans' stretches back through a labyrinth of philosophical thought, scientific ambition, and ethical dilemma. These notions, beginning with Plato’s advocacy for controlled breeding in "The Republic," set the stage for a tension-filled interplay of societal ideals and the human condition. Plato suggested that the ideal city could emerge from a deliberate breeding program, where the best citizen qualities could be propagated through selective mating. His utopian vision envisioned a society not only organized around virtue and justice but also engineered for optimal functionality. The Ideal State featured a class of guardians, whose purer bloodlines would ensure the well-being and stability of the community, framing a rudimentary perspective on eugenics that would echo through centuries of philosophical discourse.

Fast-forwarding to the modern era, the advent of genetics transformed the conversation. The late 19th and early 20th centuries brought about the rise of eugenics as a stark interpretation of Plato’s ideas, albeit with chilling and tragic consequences. The eugenic movement sought to improve the genetic quality of human populations through selective breeding, often using unethical and coercive methods. The fervor for creating 'better' humans led to widespread sterilization laws and, in extreme cases, genocide, most infamously epitomized by the horrors of Nazi Germany. This dark chapter in the history of humanity slapped society with a harsh reminder of the perils of attempting to manipulate the very essence of life to fit ideological molds.

As the 21st century dawned, the narrative shifted dramatically with advancements in genetic engineering, a field burgeoning with potential while carrying the weight of its predecessors' missteps. The mapping of the human genome unveiled profound possibilities for intervention, risk assessment, and even enhancement. Ideas that had once been relegated to the realms of fiction began to breach the frontier of reality. Enter CRISPR and other gene-editing technologies that offered unprecedented control over genetic materials, heralding a new era in human reproduction and health care. The capabilities to edit genes raised essential questions regarding ethics, access, and social equity, surfacing fears that the same ideals that inspired Plato and later eugenicists could be resurrected under more favorable guises.

In this new landscape, the idea of 'designer babies' emerged. Families began to clamor to select not just the sex of their child but also traits ranging from physical attributes to potential predispositions for intelligence and health. The notion of parental choice gained traction, turning the act of procreation into a quasi-consumer experience where genetic traits could be negotiated. This brings forth debates over what constitutes 'desirable' traits, reflecting societal biases and values—arguments that may unintentionally perpetuate existing inequalities rather than alleviate them. Compounding the concerns, the high cost of these technologies has created a chasm between the affluent, who can afford genetic enhancements, and the lower-income individuals who cannot, potentially engendering a new class of genetic elitism.

Amidst these advancements, the role of sperm banks and third-party reproductive technologies assumed a significant place in the conversation surrounding designer humans. The proliferation of sperm banks in the late 20th and early 21st centuries mirrored a growing demand for reproductive agency alongside the breakdown of traditional family structures. These establishments began to offer donors not just anonymity but also the potential for parents to select for specific traits based on a donor’s educational background, profession, and even aesthetic appearance. This represented not merely a shift in reproductive practices but an intricate dance of commodification, privacy, and selection transcending mere biology. The rise of sperm banks also intersected with questions of identity and lineage, as prospective parents navigated the complex legacy of chosen genetics versus biological heritage.

The conversations about designer humans are not solely rooted in biological definitions; they conjure visions of a future where ethical frameworks must continually evolve alongside scientific capabilities. The rapid developments in biotechnology make it imperative to establish robust ethical guidelines, so society can navigate potential pitfalls. Intellectuals, ethicists, biologists, and technologists are clamoring to piece together frameworks that can govern the use of genetic engineering responsibly, allowing for innovations while guarding against potential abuses. As with any powerful tool, responsible stewardship is critical. The decisions made today regarding genetic choice echo the philosophies of the past, as they carry the weight of moral contemplation reminiscent of Plato’s musings on governance and perfection.

Discussions of designer humans must also confront the ever-expanding societal implications. If genetic manipulation fuels notions of perfection or desirability, then who decides what those attributes are? The intersection of genetic choice with racial, gender, and class disparities amplifies concerns over a possible dystopian future in which societal hierarchies are reinforced at the genetic level. These ethical dilemmas extend to the very definition of what it means to be human, igniting substantial debates about identity, equality, and the sanctity of life itself.

Thus, the trajectory of the designer human, from ancient philosophical propositions to contemporary reproductive technologies, raises significant questions about the humanity encompassed within our biological and ethical frameworks. What does it mean to be human in a world where our biological destinies seem increasingly subject to choice and manipulation? Will the legacy of Plato’s citizen breeders morph into an era where parents shape their offspring's identities through their preferences within genetic marketplaces? Or will the lessons of the past anchor our ambitions to ensure a just society?

The dialogue surrounding designer humans invites ongoing scrutiny and reflection, cautiously fusing aspirations for a better future with the wisdom borne of our shared history. As society marches forward through the complex terrain of biotechnology and reproductive rights, there unfolds a continuous exploration of the interplay between knowledge, ethics, and our profound human experience—one that remains uncharted and yet intimately tethered to our most profound aspirations and fears. The history of the designer human is not merely an account of scientific evolution; it is an enduring testament to the intricacies of our humanity itself, an intricate weave of desire, ethics, morality, and the quest for belonging amidst the ever-changing landscape of existence.
