The question of tolerance and acceptance in contemporary society is often conflated with various identity-based movements focused on race, gender, and sexual orientation. However, when it comes to religious worldviews, the expectation for tolerance can take on a different tone and nuance. To argue that a religious worldview cannot expect the same kinds of tolerance as racial, gender, or sexual identities requires an exploration of the nature of religious belief, the historical context of intolerance, and the philosophical underpinnings that underlie societal norms around acceptance and tolerance.

To begin with, the nature of religious belief is fundamentally different from that of racial, gender, or sexual identities. Racial, gender, and sexual identities are typically intrinsic to the individual; they are inherent attributes that a person is born with or develops organically throughout their life. These identities shape one's experiences, affirm one's humanity, and manifest in undeniable ways within society. In contrast, religious beliefs are often seen as choices or convictions arrived at through personal, cultural, or social influences. This distinction creates a rift in the societal understanding of what constitutes acceptable tolerance. While we can acknowledge and embrace the existence of diverse races, genders, and orientations as integral to human identity, religious views are often perceived as less immutable and can therefore be held to a different standard of scrutiny and debate.

Moreover, the historical context of religious intolerance plays a pivotal role in shaping public perception. Throughout history, religious conflicts have created strife and division, leading to wars, persecution, and human rights violations often justified by differing religious doctrines. This tumultuous past fosters an ambiance of suspicion towards religious perspectives, making society cautious about granting them the same level of immunity from critique or challenge as seen with racial, gender, or sexual identities. For instance, while one cannot change their race or sexual orientation, religious beliefs can be argued against, debated upon, or continuously evolved. The ramifications of this capability can lead to a perception that religious beliefs may warrant critique or confrontation rather than acceptance.

Another layer to consider is the prescriptive nature of many religious beliefs, which can sometimes conflict with societal values and norms. Certain religious doctrines espouse views that are perceived to be discriminatory or exclusionary toward individuals of different faiths, sexual orientations, or gender identities. For example, some religious teachings condemn homosexuality or assert the supremacy of one faith over others, which introduces an element of challenge to the discourse surrounding tolerance. This dimension creates a dichotomy wherein some religious beliefs advocate for universal principles, while others espouse exclusivity or discrimination. The expectation, therefore, that a particular religious worldview should receive equal deference as identity-based movements can be counterintuitive to those who may feel threatened or marginalised by such beliefs.

Additionally, the difference in how tolerance is operationalized is a significant aspect of this discussion. The movements related to race, gender, and sexuality often emphasize acceptance, representation, and inclusion, while religious believers may seek freedom of expression and the right to proselytize their beliefs. This distinction means that the societal formation of tolerance manifests differently, where the former is inclined toward affirming one's identity and experiences, while the latter often involves navigating the complex interplay of belief systems. This can lead to friction, particularly in pluralistic societies, where different worldviews coexist. Those who see religion as a source of moral or ethical guidance may view it as a right to express or advocate for their belief system, while others may perceive this as encroachment upon their values or identities.

Moreover, the role of secularism in contemporary societies introduces another layer of complexity to the expectation of tolerance for religious worldviews. In many parts of the world, especially within Western democracies, increasing efforts have been made to separate state and religion, promoting secularism as a foundation for governance. In this context, religious worldviews may be viewed as at odds with the principles of equality and nondiscrimination that uphold identity-based rights. The secular space encourages critical inquiry and dialogue about beliefs, including religious ones, which can lead to an expectation of tolerance being more stringent toward religious views. The separation of church and state thereby elevates the scrutiny of religious convictions within public discourse, impacting the level of tolerance afforded to those viewpoints.

The perception of religion as a choice also frames how society reacts to potential conflicts between religious beliefs and widely accepted social norms. Unlike racial, gender, or sexual identities, religious beliefs can be viewed as malleable, open to criticism, and subject to change. This perspective holds that individuals can and should be challenged on their beliefs, especially when those beliefs appear to be at odds with social justice and equity. In this context, tolerance becomes conditional, tethered to the degree of acceptance a belief system has toward the fundamental rights and dignities of others.

Finally, the lived experiences of individuals can profoundly shape their understanding of tolerance and acceptance. Peopleâ€™s encounters with the religious beliefs of others, especially when they conflict with their identities, can lead to feelings of exclusion and even hostility. These personal narratives lend credence to the idea that religious worldviews, unlike racial, gender, or sexual identities, are less likely to evoke universal empathy. Given that identities are often a source of pride and shared experience, while religious beliefs can lead to contentious debate or even violence, the expectation for the same kind of tolerance may not only be unrealistic but potentially detrimental to societal cohesion.

In conclusion, the complexities surrounding tolerance reveal that expecting the same kind of acceptance for religious worldviews as for racial, gender, or sexual identities is fraught with challenges. The nature of religious belief as ideational rather than intrinsic, coupled with historical contexts, societal expectations, secularism, and personal experiences, crafts a landscape where the bar for tolerance is set at different heights depending on the type of identity or belief under scrutiny. While striving for a society that respects all forms of identity and belief is essential, the discrepancies in how these categories are perceived necessitate a nuanced understanding of what we can reasonably expect in our pursuit of tolerance.
