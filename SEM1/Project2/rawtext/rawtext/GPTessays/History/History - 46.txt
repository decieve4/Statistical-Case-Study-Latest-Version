Throughout the twentieth century, a wave of authoritarianism swept across various parts of the globe, marked by dictators who sought to transform their societies and create a new type of citizen—often labeled as the 'New Man.' This ambitious project was underpinned by radical ideologies that aimed to remold individuals, eradicating elements of the past and embedding a newfound purpose aligned with state objectives. Think about figures such as Joseph Stalin, Mao Zedong, and Fidel Castro, who instituted policies designed to not only exert control but also to inspire a collective identity centered around socialist or nationalist ideals. These dictators saw their subjects as malleable entities, capable of being molded through education, propaganda, and even violence. This vision of the 'New Man' represented an optimistic, albeit often oppressive, belief in the power of state-led transformation.

In stark contrast, the strongmen of the current century seem less interested in reinvention. Instead of molding their populations into something new, they often exploit existing divisions and grievances, leveraging prevailing sentiment to consolidate power and maintain social control. Figures like Vladimir Putin, Nicolás Maduro, and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan seem more focused on entrenching their authority rather than engaging in a transformative project. This shift raises critical questions: What accounts for this evolution in leadership style? Why have contemporary strongmen abandoned the grand narrative of creating a 'New Man'?

One critical factor behind this shift is a change in the technological and sociopolitical landscapes. The rise of social media and instantaneous communication has equipped populations with platforms to express dissent and organize opposition in ways that dictators of the past could scarcely imagine. The geopolitical reality has also altered significantly; there is a perpetual fear of insurrection or rebellion influenced by global interconnectedness. Consequently, modern leaders often find it more pragmatic to consolidate power by appealing to nostalgia, nationalism, or other existing sentiments rather than attempting a top-down reconstruction of societal principles. Rather than changing the fabric of society, these leaders seek to manipulate it, leaning into the idea of strongman charisma and responsiveness to popular fears and grievances.

Another significant contrast between the two eras involves the underlying ideologies that prop up strongman rule. The dictators of the last century were motivated by grand ideological visions, whether they were socialist, fascist, or a blend of both. They were often supported by a narrative that promised a better future—a utopia built on collective effort and sacrifice. In contrast, contemporary strongmen often rely on populist rhetoric that tends to be less ideologically rigid and more opportunistic. Policies may shift based on what rallies public support or serves to distract from governmental failures. Instead of a cohesive narrative that envisions the future, current leaders often resort to scapegoating and creating external enemies, appealing to nationalism and fear to maintain their grip on power.

Additionally, globalization has transformed the nature of governance and authority. In the late twentieth century, the political climate grew increasingly informed by notions of democracy, human rights, and global accountability. Economic interdependence and international organizations began to play crucial roles in promoting, if imperfectly, a certain standard of governance. Dictators were held to some degree of scrutiny at the international level, which could undermine their projects of transformation. However, the current era has seen a retreat from these norms, with an increase in bilateral dealings that often prioritize economic interests over democratic principles. This environment enables modern strongmen to operate with a level of impunity, creating an atmosphere where transformation is deemed unnecessary or counterproductive.

This leads us to consider the concept of identity politics, which has surged in contemporary political discourse. The existing social fabric of many nations contains deep-seated divisions based on ethnicity, religion, or class. Current leaders exploit these gulfs, cultivating divides rather than dismantling them. Instead of pushing for an idealized version of citizenship that embodies equality and unity, strongmen often advocate for a narrow vision that magnifies difference over commonality. By failing to pursue a collective ideal, they fortify their rule through division, thereby avoiding the risks associated with social transformation.

Moreover, the reality of governance in the twenty-first century diverges starkly from the historical precedents. Governance today often aims for pragmatic stability instead of ideological fortitude. In many contexts, dictators employ a range of methods to maintain power, including repression, co-optation, and strategic concessions, fostering an environment of fear while ensuring their support base remains intact. The traditional image of a dictator as a grand visionary has morphed, and many strongmen now focus on short-term survival tactics rather than long-term societal engineering.

In conclusion, the stark difference between the dictators of the last century and the strongmen of today can largely be attributed to differing socio-political contexts, technological advancements, ideological shifts, and the growing prevalence of identity politics. While past leaders sought to create a 'New Man' through grand narratives and radical transformation, contemporary leaders prioritize entrenching their power within existing societal structures. By manipulating existing sentiments and divisions, they succeed in maintaining a façade of stability without the need for the arduous task of redefining national identity or societal values. Thus, the allure of creating a 'New Man' has faded in favor of a more cynical approach that embraces the status quo and promotes division over unity. In this framework, modern strongmen thrive not as architects of a new ideal, but as custodians of fear and divisions, reaping the benefits while staving off any significant challenge to their rule.
