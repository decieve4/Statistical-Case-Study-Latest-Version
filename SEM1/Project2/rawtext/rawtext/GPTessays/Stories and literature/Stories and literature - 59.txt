Literary criticism has long been a domain of rigorous analysis, a space where texts are dissected, deconstructed, and understood through various theoretical frameworks. It has trained readers to engage with literature from a distance, invoking objectivity and often favoring analysis over emotion. In this environment, readers are instructed to scrub their feelings out of their reading, to adopt a critical distance that allows for a more rational and scholarly engagement with texts. This approach, while foundational for developing analytical skills, has a significant limitation: it frequently overlooks the visceral and affective experiences that literature can evoke. The interplay of emotion and meaning in texts is not merely a byproduct of the reader's response; it is often central to the essence of the literature itself. 

However, my journey through the landscape of literary criticism took an unexpected turn when I encountered the writings of a medieval mystic. The mystics, with their profound spiritual insights and personal struggles, opened a new channel through which I could access the emotional depth of literature. Their profound engagement with the divine, the self, and the world around them illuminated a path to reconnect feelings with reading. This mystical perspective provided a framework that harmonized the analytical rigor of literary criticism with the subjective resonance of emotional experience. 

Criticism has its roots in a desire for clarity, precision, and a systematic understanding of literature. Scholars often prioritize authorial intent, historical context, and textual structure, aiming to uncover layers of meaning that are sometimes obscured by surface emotions. This insistence on distancing oneself from literature fosters a particular reading methodology, one that emphasizes dispassionate analysis over the nuances of personal feeling. As a result, literature can become a puzzle to be solved, rather than a vessel for empathy, connection, and emotional exploration. While this can enrich our understanding of texts, it can also diminish our capacity for personal investment and emotional engagement. 

In contrast, the writings of mystics such as Julian of Norwich or Meister Eckhart invite us to immerse ourselves in a lived experience of the divine, to engage with our feelings as not just valid but essential. Julian of Norwich's revelations, for instance, reflect an intensely personal connection between the individual and the divine, steeped in love, suffering, and ultimately, hope. Her famous phrase “All shall be well” encapsulates a profound emotional truth that resonates on multiple levels. She urges her readers to embrace their feelings, allowing vulnerability to inform their understanding of faith and existence. In this dialogue, emotions are not seen as distractions but as gateways to deeper insight. 

Reading Julian's work through the lens of my previous literary training, I found that her mystical engagement allowed me to reclaim emotional layers often stripped away in critical discourse. Her emphasis on love transcends the rational frameworks of literary analysis, inviting readers to participate in a profound emotional experience. This connection between feelings and understanding became clear: emotions provide a reflective mirror for empathy, illuminating the text in ways that objective analysis alone cannot achieve. 

Similarly, the works of Meister Eckhart bring to light the interplay of the internal self and the external world, a theme that resonates with the complexities of modern existence. His discussions on detachment and union with the divine emphasize a kind of emotional authenticity that critiques the distancing principles often inherent in literary criticism. Eckhart’s ideas allow readers to embrace their feelings as part of their understanding, as he articulates a notion of love that is both personal and universal. The act of reading becomes a spiritual exercise, where the heart must engage as actively as the mind.

Revisiting texts of literary merit through this mystical lens has transformed my engagement with literature. It has challenged me to interrogate not just the meanings found within the words, but also the emotional landscapes they evoke. Literature is not solely an intellectual endeavor; it is deeply intertwined with life’s emotional fabric, and understanding this intertwining enriches the reading experience. Where once I was encouraged to evacuate my feelings from my interpretations, I now see them as a cornerstone of understanding the human condition expressed through art.

The dialectic between literary criticism and mystical experience continues to fuel my exploration of literature. The analytical methods I learned provide a scaffold, a necessary structure that supports a deeper engagement with texts, but it is the mystical insights that allow me to fill that scaffold with rich, resonant experiences. I have come to appreciate how the essence of literature lies not merely in thematic elements or narrative structure but in its ability to evoke authentic human feelings: love, grief, joy, and despair.

By allowing my emotions to resurface in my reading, I cultivate a space for empathy, an essential ingredient in understanding the complexities of both the writer's intent and human experiences portrayed in literature. Each reading becomes an invitation to connect not only with the text but also with my feelings, and through this connection, I discover shared humanity. The mystics teach that the journey toward understanding oneself also leads toward understanding others, and literature serves as an exquisite medium for that exploration.

As I reflect on my journey through literary criticism and the revelations brought forth by medieval mysticism, I realize the transformative power of integrating both approaches. By placing emotions back at the center of my reading, I reclaim the visceral power of literature, tapping into a wellspring of understanding that speaks to my existence. Rather than viewing literary works as cold artifacts to be analyzed in isolation, I now engage with them as vital expressions of human experience, echoing the insights of both temporal and spiritual universes. In this ecosystem of thought and feeling, I find not merely the echoes of others’ lives but also the resonances of my own. Thus, it is in this delicate tension between analysis and feeling, criticism and connection, that true literary appreciation lives.
