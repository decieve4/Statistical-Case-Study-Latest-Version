In an age where the urban landscape is increasingly infused with the echoes of literary works and artistic endeavors, the question of whether walking the city streets can still be a liberating experience invites a complex exploration. The streets of a city are often not just routes of transit; they represent a tapestry woven from the threads of history, culture, and human expression. As we stroll through these spaces, the interplay between our physical surroundings and the myriad of literary and artistic works that reference or celebrate these streets can create a rich but sometimes constrained experience of liberation.

Walking can often be seen as a meditative activity, an exercise in mindfulness that allows individuals to engage intimately with their environment. On the one hand, urban walking can liberate the individual from the confines of more conventional modes of transportation, providing one with the chance to engage with the city's vibrancy and its subtleties. This experience can evoke a sense of freedom, a connection to the environment that prompts reflection, exploration, and even a kind of sensual pleasure. However, as we walk through streets adorned with literary quotations and artistic prefigurations, there emerges a tension between liberation and constraint. 

Take, for example, the streets of Paris. As a literary and artistic hub, every corner seems to harbor references to the works of Hemingway, Balzac, and countless others. Walking in such a city can make one feel less like a solitary traveler discovering something new and more like a participant in a well-rehearsed performance. The weight of literary heritage overlays the experience, making it feel as though one is retracing preordained paths rather than forging their own. Every step may echo not just the spirit of a city, but the literal words of writers, tethering the walker within a historical narrative that can feel predetermined.

Moreover, this overlay of literary quotations and artistic influence structures our perceptions and interpretations of the urban environment. The existence of these markers can create a feeling of pressure on the walker; one is not just walking for the sake of exploration but is also enacting the role of a reader or a viewer, tasked with interpreting the visual or textual language surrounding them. This can diminish the spontaneous joys of wandering that are an intrinsic part of what makes walking liberating. Instead of being free to experience the immediacy of a moment, the walker may find themselves in a dialogue with the past, struggling against the weight of what has been said or created before.

In this sense, the liberating potential of walking is complicated by the presence of artistic overtones that can dictate a narrative. Streets become galleries, where the act of walking can lose its intimacy and spontaneity. While artworks may beautify the surroundings and add layers of meaning, they can also act as constraints that invite, or even force, specific interpretations. A pedestrian may find their discovery marred by a pre-established framework of understanding, where the joy of unmediated experience is overshadowed by a need to engage with the 'text' of the street and its established meanings.

Yet, it would be simplistic to conclude that walking is rendered non-liberating in cities steeped in literary and artistic significance. Many individuals find that such interactions enrich their experience rather than detract from it. The presence of quotations or artworks may inspire moments of insight or reflection that provoke a deeper relationship with both the city and the self. For some, encountering the echoes of literary greats while walking in their footsteps creates a shared space of imagination where the past mingles with the present, offering forms of liberation that are not solely defined by autonomy but by connection and continuity.

In a connected sense, one might also argue that these artistic prefigurations can empower individuals to create their own narratives within the established fabric of the city. Each walk can become a personal journey of reinterpretation—where literature and art are not constraints but catalysts for individual meaning-making. The multilayered urban tapestry invites walkers to infuse their experiences with their reflections and emotions, allowing them to reclaim the joy of discovery amidst the quotes and themes embedded in the streetscape. The walker is not merely a consumer but can also become an artist or author of their journey, subverting the weight of a prefigured path.

Furthermore, the juxtaposition of personal perception against societal text can inspire the act of rewriting one's own life in the context of the shared human experience. Each literary quote or artistic piece can provoke thoughts about one's existence, feelings about one's role in society, or even dreams for the future. Rather than being confined to a path laid by others, walkers can engage with and resist these layers, transforming the experience into one of active participation and self-expression.

In conclusion, while walking through city streets paved with literary quotations and artistic prefiguring can pose challenges to the notion of liberation, it simultaneously opens up spaces for connection, reflection, and personal growth. The urban landscape—rich with narrative and infused with creativity—can serve as a canvas upon which liberation may well be redefined. Freedom in these contexts becomes a multi-dimensional experience: it is not merely about moving autonomously through space, but about the synthesis of past and present, self and society, creativity, and interpretation. Thus, embracing the complexity of walking within a city alive with texts allows for an enriched experience in which liberation can coexist with acknowledgment of history and influence. In doing so, we discover that walking the city streets can still be profoundly liberating, as it becomes an act of interpretation, imagination, and ultimately, self-discovery.
